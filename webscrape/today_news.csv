https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/19/energy/co2-emissions-climate-fossil-fuels-intl/index.html|Global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels to rise by less than 1% this year as renewables and EVs take off|Finally, some good news in the battle against greenhouse gasses: Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are on track to rise less than 1% this year.That’s despite widespread concerns of a rush back to coal, oil and gas amid a global energy crunch and Russia’s war in Ukraine. We have electric vehicles and an uptake of renewables to thank for the surprisingly small increase.The International Energy Agency published its forecast in a report Wednesday, showing CO2 emissions are on track for an increase of 300 million metric tons in 2022, reaching 33.8 billion tons. That’s a far smaller rise that the jump of nearly 2 billion tons in 2021 as the world rebounded from the Covid-19 pandemic.The increase this year comes largely from the aviation sector, which was severely impacted by the pandemic.“The global energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted a scramble by many countries to use other energy sources to replace the natural gas supplies that Russia has withheld from the market. The encouraging news is that solar and wind are filling much of the gap, with the uptick in coal appearing to be relatively small and temporary,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a statement.“This means that CO2 emissions are growing far less quickly this year than some people feared – and that policy actions by governments are driving real structural changes in the energy economy. Those changes are set to accelerate thanks to the major clean energy policy plans that have advanced around the world in recent months.”The IEA said that without the major deployment of renewables and EVs globally, the rise in emissions would have been much larger, potentially as much as 1 billion tons. Demand for coal has increased as Russia’s war in Ukraine sends natural gas prices soaring, and CO2 emissions from coal power generation, driven largely by Asia, are forecast to grow by more than 200 million tons, or 2%, this year.But the increase in emissions from coal has been “relatively small” and are “considerably outweighed by the expansion of renewables,” according to the report. The world has hit record growth this year in solar and wind power, generating more than 700 terawatt-hours of energy. That’s enough to power around 67 million American homes for a year. And despite significant drought impacting huge swaths of the Northern Hemisphere, the overall picture for hydropower is still positive – global hydropower generation has increased this year and is expected to contribute more than one-fifth of growth in renewables. The global outlook comes a day after a separate report showed that the EU has generated a quarter of its power from renewable sources since Russia launched its war, which is a record for the time period.The IEA forecasts EU emissions to decrease this year, even though the bloc’s coal use is up. Several EU countries are using more coal in response to the hike in gas prices and as Russia cuts of supplies to some member states.The report comes less than three weeks before the COP27 climate negotiations begin in Egypt, where countries are expected to ensure their emissions reduction plans are aligned with the main goals of the Paris Agreement: to contain global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, but preferably 1.5 degrees, compared to pre-industrial times. The IEA’s forecast makes for a rosier-than-expected backdrop to the talks, but scientists warn that emissions should be rapidly decreasing to keep the 1.5-degree goal in sight. 
https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/disney-price-hikes-visitor-demand/index.html|Some recent Disney price hikes outpace inflation. But the crowds keep coming for now|"(CNN) — Victoria Wade flew from the East Coast to Southern California earlier this month to go to Disneyland. On the day she was set to buy her ticket, she saw the news: Prices went up overnight at US Disney parks, including admission to the original resort in Anaheim that she was about to visit.Wade had budgeted her trip carefully. She said with a price tag that was suddenly $40 or $50 more, she cut her visit one day short.""I had the money ready, and then they increased it,"" said Wade, a content creator who lives in Maryland. ""It was too much to pay.""While many theme parks raise prices annually, some of the Disney price hikes on October 11 outpaced the US annual inflation rate of 8.2%.Prices went up for busier-season admission at Disneyland in California, hotel valet parking, the Genie+ skip-the-line service, hundreds of food items at Disney World in Florida and custom-built light sabers and droids, among other things.For a family of two adults and two children (ages 3 to 9) to park a car at Disneyland Resort during the busier season around Christmas, hop between its two parks and use the Genie+ service, they would now spend $1086 for that single day. That's before they eat any food or buy any souvenirs. Before the recent price hikes, the cost was $988 (an increase of almost 10%). Pete Werner, CEO of wdwinfo.com, one of the oldest Disney fan websites, said he thinks the Disney company has neglected its longtime fans and passholders in favor of attracting more casual visitors who generally spend more money per visit. ""The bottom line is 'make more money with fewer people. And we don't care who we price out to do it.' And I'm going to tell you that the quality of the product is less, in my opinion, is less now than it was prior to the pandemic, yet the price has gone up considerably,"" he said. When asked about earning more per guest with fewer in attendance, a Disney official instead described ""the positive outcome of a strategy that prioritizes the guest experience. When we focus on delivering a world-class experience, we know our guests will spend more time with us immersed in our stories.""There are fewer of the least expensive ticketsWhile the cheapest single-day ticket at Disneyland has stayed at $104 since 2019, there are fewer days of the year where this kind of ""low season"" ticket is available.On the other end of the spectrum, a single-day ticket in Anaheim, California, that allows entry to one park during a busy season such as Christmas jumped from $164 to $179, about 9.2%. To add the ability to hop between Disneyland and Disney California Adventure is an extra $65, up 8.3% from $60. And some things that were once rolled in with park admission now cost extra. Carlye Wisel, a theme park journalist and podcaster, gave an example of an extra cost that used to be included: the line-skipping service called Genie+ that has replaced FastPass. ""These parks cannot be more expensive and more difficult to visit,"" Wisel said. ""And what we're seeing with Genie+ and individual lightning lanes is that you are now paying even more not just for a product that used to be complimentary, but for one that can be very burdensome to use during your visit,"" she said.Admission price increases at Disney's main competitor in Southern California, Universal Studios Hollywood, were not so steep this year. Universal Studios Hollywood has a more expensive ""low season"" ticket priced at $109, which has not changed since 2018. But its most expensive single-day ticket increased 3.9% during its last round of price hikes in January, according to MouseSavers.com. A skip-the-line service at this park can cost guests more than $100 extra per day.""Universal's ticket pricing is reflective of the dynamic entertainment and immersive experiences we offer, and we have a wide range of ticket options available to meet the individual needs of our guests,"" a Universal Parks & Resorts spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday.Disney crowds are still coming for nowWerner said every time prices go up, he hears the same refrain.""For 25 years, I've heard that 'I'm not going to Disney World' on one hand, while they're handing them their wallet with the other,"" said Werner, who also owns Dreams Unlimited Travel.And while people may be facing a potential recession, he said that is very different from actually being in a recession. Right now, he said he's not seeing people canceling their vacations to Disney's Florida resort.Wade, the recent Disneyland visitor who was once a Walt Disney World employee, said she ended up visiting Disneyland in California this month on a Monday and found it ""ridiculously busy.""She said she saw a lot of people buying Genie+, which allows Disney visitors to skip the regular line for a faster one called a ""lightning lane.""The service went from a flat fee to a dynamic pricing structure dependent on demand in the October 11 price hikes. On the West Coast, the base price jumped from $20 to $25. On the East Coast, the service that launched at $15 last year is now supposed to range between $15 and $22 for October, with further increases possible.""People were still buying them, and the lightning lanes were as long as the standby lines,"" Wade said.A park reservation system that began with the Covid-19 pandemic is still in place, and popular dates are booked up well in advance. 'Cheaper' seasonStill, Disney touts its broad range of prices to meet all budgets. A Disney official told CNN that the company is purposeful about creating tiers of ticket and hotel price points to allow more guests who want to visit the parks to have that opportunity.""There are more ways than ever before to visit a Disney Park. Our focus is to provide a great guest experience, and we do that by putting choices in the hands of our guests to decide how and when to experience our resort,"" a Disney official said.For example, a Disneyland ticket for a Tuesday in February will cost much less than a crowded Saturday in December. Disney also pointed to its 35 hotels in the United States that range from AAA four-star to budget. Disney guests are also allowed to bring in their own food and nonalcoholic drinks, as long as they're not in glass containers.Don Munsil, president and co-owner of Mouse Savers Inc., has tracked theme park prices for more than 20 years.""I'm a longtime fan. I don't love this. But it's pretty clear that it's working. Like, Disney is making money,"" Munsil said.Munsil said the tiered pricing by season, or the optional add-on costs of Genie+, are ways to allow people of different income levels to visit the parks, rather than keeping prices flat across the board.As far as finding those deals to go during a slower season, ""Is it possible? Sure. Going to Mars is possible,"" said Werner. ""It's not just the cost of the hotel room. It's the combined cost of all the things associated with the Disney vacation. And we haven't even gotten to souvenirs yet. So the cost of popcorn has gone up, the cost of a hamburger has gone up. You have to take these things in totality.""Are would-be guests going elsewhere?Recent Disneyland guest Wade once had an annual pass at the Orlando resort, but she gave up her Disney pass this year because of the cost. She still holds annual passes at Hershey Park, Cedar Fair Parks and Universal Orlando Resort.""They're essentially pricing out lower-middle-class families. ... They want to bring in that more luxury-brand market. I've seen it with certain products that they put out just testing the waters,"" Wade said. ""I see them losing a lot of loyalty from this generation.""While cost is a major factor, she said there are also more burdensome rules and complicated systems to visiting Disney parks in the post-Covid era compared with other resorts.Wade said she was recently in Orlando for a week visiting various theme parks: ""I was actually just there at Disney World last month. And it was literally the most stressful day out of my whole trip."" She said teasing out all the strategies she needed in terms of reservations, line-shortening apps and such involves much more work than visiting other resorts.Competition to DisneySome experts say other brands are making gains as they focus on higher quality entertainment and new attractions to draw traditional Disney fans away.""Granted, it is not the same experience as Disney,"" Wisel said. ""But Universal does have a lot of really, really big banner openings coming down the pike.""Super Nintendo World opens in the Hollywood park in early 2023. A new theme park called Epic Universe will be added to its Orlando resort in 2025.Werner said that his travel agency is booking triple the amount of Universal Orlando trips compared with the years before the pandemic while his audience has not changed.""I call it the 'Trail of Tears' up I-4. People going from Disney World up to Universal,"" he said. But he added that while fans are discovering other options beyond Disney World, his agency is booking an unprecedented number of Disney Cruise Line trips.A Disney official told CNN that since 2016, its parks around the world have seen more than 200 new lands, attractions, experiences and festivals, citing more for guests to do and better food and beverage offerings.While travel agents, hardcore fans and theme park journalists debate whether a product is worth the price, Wisel points out the emotional attachment that brings certain people back to a park such as Disneyland, which represents more than a place to visit.""It is generational. It is part of our lives. And regardless of all the pricing changes and the difficulty, I think it still resonates with people so deeply that we suffer, but we suffer for what we love.""Top image: Visitors to Disneyland walk in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle on September 3, 2021.

https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/19/football/european-super-league-new-format-relaunch-spt-intl/index.html|European Super League back in three years with different format, new chief executive tells FT|The European Super League (ESL), which folded just 48 hours after its launch in 2021, is planning to make a comeback in three years, its new chief executive told Wednesday’s Financial Times.German television executive Bernd Reichart said that new formats were being explored and that he hoped to have “active and extended dialogue” across soccer in order to find a new solution. “We want to reach out to stakeholders in the European football community and broaden this vision. Even fans will have a lot of sympathy for the idea,” the former chief executive of RTL Deutschland told the FT. “It is a blank slate. Format will never be an obstacle.” In April last year, 12 of Europe’s biggest and most successful clubs announced their intention to breakaway from the current UEFA competition format and create their very own Super League.The proposal, which essentially created a closed shop for the most financially powerful clubs, triggered fury from fans who vehemently criticized the plans. Many claimed it was a power grab, intended to guarantee the clubs status and revenue, which some of them weren’t currently earning from their performances on the pitch.The response forced Manchester United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, AC Milan, Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid to pull out, but Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus have remained active members.A22 Sports Management, the organization now representing the three remaining clubs, believes a relaunch for the 2024-25 season is a “reasonable” expectation. “European club football is facing existential problems,” Reichart said in a video posted on A22’s website. “European football is losing its undisputed leadership position in global sports. It’s not living up to its potential by not offering the best matches week after week.“The current financial model in football is broken and unsustainable. Financial controls are inadequate and insufficiently enforced leading to competitive imbalances and financial stress.“Clubs should be sovereign and master of their own destiny since they bear all risks and all investments. “Today they are not allowed to freely organize themselves at European level, while almost every domestic league is run independently by clubs, governance of European competition resides only with UEFA … why?”Real Madrid President Florentino Perez, one of the main architects for the proposed ESL, recently said European football was “sick” and that changes are needed to stop younger fans drifting away from the sport. He also pointed to how infrequently top teams in football face each other and said midweek European competition should offer fans matches between “the strongest teams and with the best players in the world” throughout the year.In a statement posted by A22, Barcelona’s president Joan Laporta said his club was committed to creating open competition within the new structure. “Please forget about the Super League format and whether it is a rich, elitist, open or closed competition,” said Laporta. “If Barça is there, it will be because it is an open competition, with the best criteria of professionalism at all levels, based on meritocracy and with total respect for the state leagues. “I assure you that you will have news soon, because the appropriate channels of dialogue will be established, working with the entire football family, without pressure and for the benefit of all. Bearing in mind the principle of solidarity, meritocracy, and I insist, offering solutions for all clubs,” added Laporta.Meanwhile, Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli said “the overall goal is to put fans and footballers, the souls of the most beautiful sport in the world, back at the center of this industry.”Previously UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin has said the “shameless” plans for a new Super League were akin to taking “football hostage.”UEFA did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment regarding Reichart’s comments.
https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/19/us/oklahoma-dismembered-bodies-investigation-wednesday/index.html|Investigators say they’re chasing new leads every day to uncover what led to the killings of 4 men found in an Oklahoma river|Investigators are following leads every day to find out how dismembered bodies of four men ended up in an Oklahoma river, but whenever water is involved, it makes it much more difficult to identify evidence, the police chief said.The men – Mark Chastain, 32; Billy Chastain, 30; Mike Sparks, 32; and Alex Stevens, 29 – were reported missing by relatives after leaving Billy Chastain’s Okmulgee, Oklahoma, home on bicycles the evening of October 9, police have said.Days later, their bodies were found – all of them having been shot and dismembered – in a river outside Okmulgee, a city of about 11,000 people roughly a 35-mile drive south of Tulsa.Okmulgee Police Chief Joe Prentice described there being a “very violent event,” as he announced Monday the missing persons case had turned into a murder investigation.A man who was named as a person of interest in the gruesome killings, 67-year-old Joe Kennedy, was taken into custody Tuesday in Florida on an unrelated charge of grand theft of a motor vehicle and is being held with no bond, authorities said. He is also being held on a warrant issued for his arrest in Okmulgee County District Court in relation to a shooting in 2012. Kennedy has not been named a suspect in the killings. Police have said they want to speak him to again but have not specified why.It’s unclear whether Kennedy has an attorney. He’s set to appear before a Volusia County, Florida, judge Wednesday afternoon, according to the clerk of the courts.While it remains unclear exactly what led up to the men’s deaths, it appears they were planning to commit a crime when they left Billy Chastain’s home, Prentice said.That belief is based on “information supplied by a witness who reports they were invited to go with the men to quote, unquote, ‘Hit a lick big enough for all of them,’” the chief said Monday in a news conference. “That is common terminology for engaging in some type of criminal behavior, but we do not know what they were planning or where they planned to do it,” he added.As the investigation continues, the discovery of the dismembered bodies has raised more questions. Detectives, who have not recovered the firearm used in the killings, are contending with the difficult task of combing through the river. All four bodies found in the river “were submerged in water for what appears to be an extended period of time,” Prentice previously told CNN. That meant that the coroner faced greater difficulty identifying the bodies and police face a complicated investigation at the river, which “appears to be a dump site,” the chief said.“Water always affects decomposition, and depending on temperature, depending on the current flow, there’s a lot of different factors that do that,” Prentice said during a news conference Monday. “Whenever water is involved, it makes it much more difficult to identify evidence.”Prentice said investigators have to be more methodical as they sift through the water “because it’s so easy to miss evidence.”The chief said he’s never worked on a case with so many dismembered bodies, and it took several days to recover all the remains.“Although the official cause and manner of death is still pending, each victim suffered gunshot wounds,” Prentice said. “All four bodies were dismembered before being placed in the river.”As the investigation continues, the chief said the department requested additional video surveillance from businesses in the area and continues to follow up on tips about different sightings.As of Monday, police had not recovered any bicycles the men were riding when they left the home, the chief said.After the men were reported missing, police said they believed at least two of them were carrying cell phones. Investigators traced the phones’ path, finding the devices went to two salvage yards – one about 5 miles from the river, and the other about 10 to 12 miles from the river, Prentice told CNN Saturday.He cautioned that the phones’ paths didn’t necessarily have to be the path that the men traveled.Police later found “evidence of a violent event” on a property adjoining one of those locations, the chief said without elaborating.Kennedy, the person of interest in the case, is the owner of the salvage yards, the chief said.Police have said Kennedy denied knowing the men and he appeared cooperative with investigators during an interview Friday afternoon.But the chief later announced Kennedy had gone missing. Two days later, Kennedy was arrested in Daytona Beach Shores in a vehicle reported stolen Monday, Okmulgee Police said.According to the arrest warrant in Florida, he was reported as a missing person, but Kennedy told officers he was not a missing person and was not in any danger.Jon Chastain, the uncle of Mark and Billy Chastain, told CNN their family was “shocked,” “outraged,” and filled with “heartbreak” when police announced the brothers, along with their two friends, were found murdered and dismembered.Chastain said he could not envision his nephews doing anything to warrant so much violence.Mark was the father of two children, and Billy had four children. Chastain described them as hard workers and good fathers who loved their families.“Whatever was going on, I don’t know. But what I do know is we need some justice for this,” Chastain said.Mark Chastain’s wife, Jessica Chastain, told CNN affiliate KOKI she reported her husband missing the day he disappeared. Now, she says though her husband’s death still doesn’t feel real, she is focused on getting justice for him.“Eventually the truth will come out. Eventually,” she said.
https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/19/politics/tampa-police-body-cam-video-voter-fraud-arrest-florida-desantis/index.html|Florida police cameras show August arrests for alleged voter fraud|Newly obtained police body camera video shows Tampa Police officers arresting confused and stunned convicted felons for allegedly voting illegally in the 2020 election. “I voted, but I ain’t commit no fraud,” Romona Oliver can be heard saying on police body cam video obtained from the Tampa Police Department. “I got out. The guy told me that I was free and clear to go vote or whatever because I had done my time,” she said. Oliver’s attorney says she received a voter registration card and thought she was eligible to vote. The videos, first reported by The Tampa Bay Times, provide a fresh glimpse into a far-reaching state operation earlier this summer to crack down on supposed voter fraud. On August 18, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced the Florida Department of Law Enforcement arrested 20 individuals accused of illegally voting in the 2020 election. He unveiled the charges at a celebratory news conference at the Broward County Courthouse, where he was flanked by police officers and state Attorney General Ashley Moody.“As convicted murderers and felony sex offenders, none of the individuals were eligible to vote,” DeSantis said. “They did not get their rights restored, and yet they went ahead and voted anyway,” DeSantis said at the time. “That is against the law, and now they’re going to pay the price for it.”Mark Rankin, a Tampa-based attorney, who is representing Oliver pro-bono, told CNN that Oliver served almost 20 years in state prison for a conviction for second degree murder.“She served her time and got out. And she got out around the time that Amendment 4 was passed, which affected the rights of felons to vote. Her understanding was that felons had their rights restored.”Rankin says Oliver was approached at the bus stop one day on the way to work by someone registering voters, and she told them she was a felon. The person then told Oliver that she could fill out the form and if she was eligible, she would get a voter registration card and if she wasn’t eligible, she wouldn’t get the card. Oliver received a voter registration card in the mail. She went to the Department of Motor Vehicles office later to get a new driver’s license and was sent an updated voter registration card with her new address, according to Rankin.“She was twice told by the State of Florida and the local Supervisor of Elections, ‘Here’s your voter registration card. You are, as far as we’re concerned, legally eligible to vote.’ And so she voted and she was shocked when she was arrested.”“She was shocked and upset because she thought her rights had been restored by the amendment. She didn’t know any different. And the State of Florida, she believed, was telling her that she was eligible to vote. And now she’s had the rug pulled out from under her. She never would have voted if she knew that she was ineligible,” Rankin said.Oliver pleaded not guilty to the illegal voting charge and has a trial set for December in Hillsborough County. County records show she was released on her own recognizance the same day she was arrested. The Tampa Police Department conducted arrests on behalf of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the originating agency for the investigation, a police department spokesperson told CNN. CNN also reached out to the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office, which was involved in some of the arrests. The arrests marked the first public demonstration of the Florida Office of Election Crimes and Security, a controversial new investigative agency created this year and championed by DeSantis to probe voting irregularities. Created under a sweeping bill passed this year to overhaul voting in Florida, the office was given a staff of 15 to initiate probes and allowed DeSantis to assign 10 state law enforcement officers to help investigate election crimes.But almost immediately after the state announced the charges, questions began to surface about the arrests and whether the individuals knew they were violating the law when they cast a ballot.According to state law, it is the job of the Florida Department of State to “identify those registered voters who have been convicted of a felony” and “notify the supervisor and provide a copy of the supporting documentation indicating the potential ineligibility of the voter to be registered.”In the five counties where there were arrests, the local supervisor of elections office told CNN that the state did not inform the arrested individuals that they were ineligible to vote.DeSantis continued to defend the arrests and in a later news conference blamed some local election offices who, he said, “just don’t care about the election laws.” But the Office of Election Crimes and Security wrote a letter to an elections supervisor that the individuals voted illegally “through no fault of your own.” The letter, obtained by CNN, was sent on August 18 by Pete Antonacci, who served as the first director of the Office of Election Crimes and Security until he died September 23 after a medical episode at the Florida state Capitol.The arrests captured in police body cam footage also are illustrative of the confusion that still surrounds a successful 2018 constitutional amendment in Florida to restore the voting rights of some felons that had completed their sentences. The constitutional amendment, approved overwhelmingly by voters in a statewide referendum, said people convicted of murder and certain sex crimes were not eligible to have their rights restored. But the law that implemented the constitutional amendment specified that an ineligible felon who erroneously votes is in violation of the law if they “willfully submit any false voter registration information.” State Sen. Jeff Brandes, a St. Petersburg Republican and the sponsor of that legislation, has said on social media that most convicted felons have no intent to break the law.After the Tampa Bay Times published the body cam video, Brandes tweeted from his verified account, “Looks like the opposite of ‘willingly,’” and he suggested that state will struggle to prove its case in court.“I hope they have the courage to drop charges or go to trial and produce evidence of willful intent,” Brandes wrote.

https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/18/sport/iranian-climber-elnaz-rekabi-hijab-intl-spt/index.html|Iranian rock climber arrives back in Tehran after competing without hijab|A female Iranian rock climber, who did not wear a hijab at an international competition in South Korea, has returned to Iran as Iranian groups based abroad raised alarms over her fate back home.Elnaz Rekabi, 33, competed without a hijab during the International Federation of Sport Climbing’s Asian Championships in Seoul on Sunday. Videos of her wearing a headband with her hair in a ponytail while competing spread on social media. Rekabi arrived in Tehran early on Wednesday morning, state media IRNA reported. Videos posted to social media show her arriving at the capital’s Imam Khomeini International Airport. She was also seen speaking to media. More videos posted to social media appeared to show crowds gathered both inside and outside of the airport, chanting “Elnaz the hero.”It is unclear whether Rekabi is under detention or if she will face repercussions.  Her return to Iran comes amid nationwide protests in the country calling for greater freedoms for women, following the death of a 22-year-old woman who died in police custody after her arrest for allegedly wearing her hijab improperly.In a story posted on Rekabi’s Instagram page on Tuesday, the athlete said she was called to climb the wall “unexpectedly” which “unintentionally” created a problem with her hair covering.“Due to bad timing and unexpectedly being called to climb the wall, I inadvertently created a problem with my head covering,” she wrote.“Apologizing for the worries that I caused … currently, according to the pre-determined schedule I am returning to Iran with the team,” the IG story post said.She reiterated that she had “accidentally” competed without a jihab in an interview with state media IRNA on her arrival in Tehran on Wednesday.“Regarding this topic, as I already explained on my social media stories – it totally happened accidentally,” Rekabi said, when asked by the interviewer about the incident. “I was unexpectedly called upon and I attended the competition. I somehow got busy with the equipment, and it made me negligent to the hijab,” she continued.Iran mandates women wear a hijab when officially representing the country abroad.In an interview Tuesday, before the climber arrived back in Tehran, her brother Davoud Rekabi told state-aligned Tasmin news agency that his sister would “always play wearing the national team’s uniform.”“My sister had a hijab but was wearing a headband and unfortunately some people [took advantage] of this issue,” he said.“My sister is a child of Iran, and she will always play wearing the national team’s uniform. Elnaz belongs to this land, and she will always play for this country,” he continued.It is unclear whether his comments were made under duress.A news website critical of the Iranian regime, IranWire, alleged that Rekabi will be transferred to prison upon arrival, prompting rights groups to worry about what would happen to her.  Amnesty International said Monday it was alarmed by the prospect of Rekabi’s return.“Elnaz Rekabi should not be forcibly returned to Iran,” Amnesty said in a statement, adding that “she is at real risk of arbitrary arrest, torture, and other ill-treatment for violating the authorities’ compulsory veiling rules,” Amnesty wrote.CNN cannot independently verify reports of Rekabi being forced to return to Iran. The Iranian embassy in Seoul said that Rekabi departed on Tuesday along with “other members of the team” and “strongly denied all the fake, false news and disinformation.” In the Twitter post, the embassy posted a picture of Rekabi from previous games in Russia where she was competing wearing the hijab.“It is understood that all members of the Iranian delegation including Elnaz Rekabi have already left Korea after attending the sport event,” South Korea’s Foreign Affairs Ministry told CNN in a statement.“The punishment has already started,” director of Norway-based rights group Iran Human Rights Mahmood Reza Amiry-Moghaddam told CNN on Tuesday.“You know, the fact that she was incommunicado for one full day…and then she just wrote this one message on her Instagram. So, the pressure on her started already from South Korea,” he said, “I don’t think anyone believes in what Iranian authorities say.”The International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) said it’s “fully aware of news” regarding Rekabi and it’s their “understanding” that she is returning to Iran.“There is a lot of information in the public sphere regarding Ms Rekabi and as an organisation we have been trying to establish the facts. We have also been in contact with Ms Rekabi and the Iranian Climbing Federation,” a statement by the IFSC said.“We will continue to monitor the situation as it develops on her arrival,” the statement said.Calls placed to two Iranian team coaches currently in Seoul were not answered. 
https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/19/us/california-dive-boat-captain-misconduct-indictment/index.html|Former California dive boat captain indicted on misconduct charge in connection with fire that killed 34|A federal grand jury indicted a former California boat captain Tuesday on a misconduct charge related to a fire that tore through his vessel on Labor Day 2019, killing 34 people, prosecutors said.Jerry Nehl Boylan, 68, was charged with one count of misconduct or neglect of a ship officer, the US Attorney’s Office in the Central District of California said in a news release.The charge stems from a blaze that broke out on the Conception, a 75-foot dive boat, in the middle of the night on September 2, 2019, as it was anchored near Santa Cruz Island in California’s famed Channel Islands. Five crew members, including Boylan, were able to escape the burning vessel. But 33 passengers and one crew member who had been sleeping below deck died. The torched the vessel was on the last day of a three-day dive trip.Tuesday’s indictment comes after a federal judge dismissed a manslaughter charge against Boylan last month, saying the charges failed to allege gross negligence, according to court documents.The new indictment was filed to clearly allege gross negligence, prosecutors said. Prosecutors accuse Boylan of “a series of failures and the abandoning of his ship, which constituted ‘misconduct, gross negligence, and inattention to his duties’ and led to the deaths of 34 victims,” according to the news release on the new indictment.The indictment accuses Boylan of failing to have a night watch or roving patrol, failing to conduct sufficient fire drills and crew training and failing to provide firefighting instructions or directions to the crew after the fire started, according to the news release.CNN has reached out to Boylan’s attorneys for comment. He’s expected to be arraigned “in the coming weeks,” according to the release.If convicted, Boylan could face up to 10 years in prison.All of the 34 victims died of smoke inhalation and suffered burns after losing consciousness, officials said.The deadly fire may have been caused by cell phones and batteries left charging overnight, federal safety regulators said, adding the tragedy could have been prevented by a night watchman. The National Transportation Safety Board faulted the boat’s operator for not requiring a crew member to patrol the craft as an overnight watchman, as mandated by the boat’s license and Coast Guard regulations.“Had a crew member been awake, and patrolling the 75-foot-long Conception on the morning of the fire, it is likely that he or she would likely have discovered the fire at an early stage allowing time to fight the fire and give warning to passengers and crew to evacuate,” said Andrew Ehlers, who oversaw one portion of the investigation.Attorney Douglas Schwartz previously said in a statement on behalf of the boat’s owner, Truth Aquatics, that a crew member had checked the area where the fire was believed to have been concentrated soon before it ignited; he did not point to any evidence the crew member had remained awake.
https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/19/us/kristin-smart-murder-verdicts-wednesday/index.html|Kristin Smart’s family hopes guilty verdict in her 1996 murder brings them some closure|The family of Kristin Smart, who was murdered in California in 1996, is hoping the guilty verdict a jury returned Tuesday against her killer will bring them some closure as her body has never been found.“Almost three decades ago, our lives were irreparably changed on the night you disappeared. We hope this verdict helps deliver not just answers, but also a peace and sense of closure that have eluded us for 26 years,” the family said in a message to Smart in their statement following the verdict. “Not a single day goes by where you aren’t missed, remembered, loved, and celebrated.”The family’s remarks came after a jury in California found Paul Flores, 45, guilty of first-degree murder in Smart’s killing, prosecutors said.Flores and Smart were both freshmen attending Cal Poly San Luis Obispo when she disappeared in May 1996, authorities said. Flores was the last person to see Smart alive and prosecutors argued he raped or attempted to rape Smart and then killed her in his dorm room. Prosecutors also accused Ruben Flores, Paul Flores’ father, of helping his son move Smart’s body to his Arroyo Grande home and hiding it for a time under his deck.In a decision by a separate jury announced Tuesday, Ruben Flores was found not guilty of being an accessory to Smart’s murder, the San Luis Obispo County District Attorney’s Office said in a news release.Although Smart’s body has not been recovered, she was declared dead in 2002. “Without Kristin, there is no joy or victory with this verdict, we all know it did not have to be this way,” the Smart family said. “After 26 years, with today’s split verdicts, we learned that our quest for justice for Kristin will continue.”The family thanked investigators and prosecutors for their efforts and expressed gratitude to Chris Lambert for his 2019 podcast highlighting the case, “Your Own Backyard,” which they said shined a spotlight “in our darkest hours by sharing Kristin’s voice and story.”“Our family is comforted and strengthened by the knowledge that Kristin continues to be held in the hearts and memories of many,” the family said. “We will never be able to personally thank everyone, but please know our gratitude and love goes out to each of you who have been with us on this long, overwhelming, and emotional journey.”Paul Flores’ conviction carries a sentence of 25 years to life in prison, prosecutors said. He is scheduled to be sentenced December 9.The Smart family described the decades-long search for answers in the case as an “agonizingly long journey with more downs than ups.” The case haunted the small college city of San Luis Obispo in 1996.Billboards in the community of about 47,000 residents displayed Smart’s face, asking the public for any information that could lead to clues in her case. She was last seen near her dorm but never made it to her room, police said. Paul Flores had walked her home, prosecutors said. Her friends and family never heard from Smart again.Nearly 25 years after she disappeared, authorities said new evidence led to the arrest of Paul and Ruben Flores in April 2021, which Smart’s family called a “bittersweet day.”Deputy District Attorney Christopher Peuvrelle told jurors during the trial in July that searches of Ruben Flores’ house turned up soil samples that tested positive for human blood, CNN affiliate KSBY reported.In documents filed in the case, a sheriff’s office detective stated investigators are “in possession of biological evidence that makes them believe the victim was buried underneath the defendant’s (Ruben Flores) deck at one time.”Prosecutors believe the father and son moved the body to another location before authorities searched the property, affiliates KEYT and KRON reported.Following his acquittal on the accessory charge Tuesday, Ruben Flores said “there is no evidence against anybody,” and he is worried about his son. “It’s too bad the system works …. on feelings instead of facts,” Ruben Flores said.An attorney representing Paul Flores insisted he’s innocent, saying there’s a lack evidence and witnesses. “A bunch of conspiracy theories not backed by facts,” said attorney Robert Sanger, referring to the prosecution’s case, according to CNN affiliate KEYT.
https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/19/investing/premarket-trading-stocks/index.html|It’s been 35 years since the epic Black Monday crash. What have investors learned?|October 19, 1987. A brief but violent stock market crash. Can it happen again? Probably not. The Dow plummeted 22.6% on that day, a date that has since been immortalized as Black Monday. To put that into context, a drop of that magnitude would be a nearly 7,000 point slide based on the Dow’s current levels. In 1987, that was about a 508-point drop.What’s happening: Rules have been put into place since 1987, so-called circuit breakers and trading halts, that would prevent a plunge of that magnitude from ever occurring again. There have been some mini so-called flash crashes in stocks since then but nothing even remotely close to the type of alarm seen on that Black Monday, when the inflation rate was 3.6%, George Bush (the first one) was the Republican nominee for president and a gallon of gas cost 89 cents. It was clearly a panic-induced sell-off. CNN Business spoke to Jon Hirtle, a broker at Goldman Sachs in 1987, to get his recollections about Black Monday. Hirtle, now executive chairman and founder of Hirtle Callaghan, a wealth management firm that has about $20 billion in assets, said that Black Monday was a “jaw dropping, what the heck” moment for Wall Street. The normal mechanics of trading simply stopped working.“You couldn’t get a bid. People tried to sell and couldn’t. Normally, you just put an order in, and it was done,” he said.Hirtle said it’s also important to remember that in 1987, most trades were physically handled  on the floor of the exchange. Now, it’s mostly done electronically. That’s led some Wall Street veterans to derisively refer to the NYSE as nothing more than a glorified TV studio. “The circumstances that led to 1987 have changed dramatically,” Hirtle said. Still, there are some similarities between now and 35 years ago. For one, stocks (prior to their 2022 pullback) were trading at historically high valuations. And there is a lot of speculation in the market right now, with traders betting on meme stocks like GameStop(GME) and AMC(AMC), bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as well as other speculative investments. In 1987, many investors were banking on a continued surge in corporate mergers. It was the era of the “Barbarians at the Gate”, when big private equity firms were taking over blue chip firms. There seems to be even more risk-taking these days, Hirtle said. “There is no question that there is more gambling in the markets now.” Hirtle also noted that while interest rates now are moving higher thanks to a recent series of Fed hikes, they are nowhere near the levels from 1987. The 10-year Treasury bond yield is currently about 4%, compared to nearly 10% just before the Black Monday crash. So rates have a lot more room to run before they truly become problematic.But there’s another big difference between now and 1987 that could be more ominous. Black Monday turned out, in hindsight, to be a blip in an otherwise strong bull market and  strong economy during the Reagan years. The bottom line: The current bout of market volatility, however, is a worrisome sign and potential harbinger of a recession. That could mean more downside ahead for stocks.“The big issue that we are confronted with is whether earnings forecasts for next year are correct,” said Marco Pirondini, head of equities at Amundi US. “Earnings expectations for 2023 are factoring in a lot of growth expected for an economy that will, at the very least slow down significantly and very likely enter a recession.”Pirondini, who has been with Amundi since 1991, said that even though interest rates are still historically low, the speed and magnitude of the current rate hikes are unprecedented. The Fed could wind up breaking something in the markets or economy. “It’s tough to predict the consequences of the Fed tightening,” he said.The Fed’s moves have led to a lot more market volatility this year, and top Wall Street firms are dealing with the fallout. One of them, Dow component Goldman Sachs, is shaking up its operating structure as a result.Goldman Sachs announced Tuesday that it is merging its trading and investment banking businesses into a single unit. The company will also fold its digital consumer banking business Marcus into its wealth management division.CEO David Solomon said that the move is a “realignment” that will allow Goldman Sachs to better serve its customers.Investors seemed to like the news. Shares of Goldman Sachs(GS) rallied after the announcement. It helped that the company also reported earnings and revenue, that while down from a year ago, topped Wall Street’s forecasts. Some investors had been expecting a more disappointing report after top rival Morgan Stanley(MS) posted earnings and revenue last week that missed consensus estimates.There are growing concerns on Wall Street (and Main Street) about an economic downturn. One top firm, credit rating agency Fitch, is ringing the recession alarm bells, too. But there is some good news. Sorta.As CNN’s Matt Egan explains, Fitch said that it is expecting the recession to be short and shallow, starting in the spring in 2023 and probably not lasting long. In that respect. Fitch thinks the recession will be more like the one in the early 1990s and not a “great” one like in 2008.That means job losses probably won’t be as severe, although Fitch does expect the unemployment rate to rise from current levels of 3.5% to a peak of 5.2% in 2024. Still, at the end of the day consumers are in better financial shape now than they were in 2008. So are banks. But Fitch said inflation will “prove too much of a drain” for individuals and businesses.On tap this morning:US housing starts; UK and Europe inflation; earnings from Procter & Gamble(PG), Travelers(TRV) and Baker Hughes(BKR)Coming after the close:Earnings from Tesla(TSLA), IBM(IBM) and Alcoa(AA)Due Thursday: US weekly jobless claims; US existing home sales; earnings from Ericsson(ERIC), AT&T(T), American Airlines(AAL), Dow(DOW), Philip Morris(PM), Union Pacific(UNP), Alaska Air(ALK), CSX(CSX), Snap(SNAP) and Boston Beer(SAM)
