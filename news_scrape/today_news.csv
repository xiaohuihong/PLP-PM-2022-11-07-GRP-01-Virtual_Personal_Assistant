Another protester, who is yet to be sentenced, then poured a can of tomato soup on the first man's shirt before affixing his own hand to a wall mounting. A third person filmed the stunt.""How do you feel when you see something beautiful and priceless being apparently destroyed before your eyes?"" one of the men asked onlookers in English. ""Do you feel outraged? Good. Where is that feeling when you see the planet being destroyed before our very eyes?""Gallery visitors can be heard objecting with cries of ""obscene"" and ""shame on you.""""This painting is protected by glass, it's just fine,"" the protester continued. ""Vulnerable people in the Global South, they are not protected. The future of our children is not protected.""The museum said the 17th-century masterpiece was ""undamaged,"" and it was returned to public view the next day. The Netherlands Public Prosecution Service added that the 19th-century frame had, however, been damaged in the protest.In a press release announcing ruling, the prosecutors said they had wanted to ""send out a signal"" to activists, adding: ""An artwork hanging there for everyone, all of us to enjoy, has been smeared by (defendants) who felt their message took precedence over everything else.""Prosecutors had initially asked for four months, with two suspended, but the judge said she did not want her sentence to discourage other people from demonstrating.The two men went to trial through a fast-track judgment on charges of destruction and open violence against the painting. The third activist, who did not agree with the trial being fast-tracked, will appear in court on Friday. Prosecutors said all three are ""jointly responsible"" for the act.The ruling follows a string of anti-fossil-fuel demonstrations targeting art galleries, car showrooms and company headquarters in recent weeks. Last month, two demonstrators pelted Claude Monet's ""Haystacks"" painting with mashed potatoes at the Barberini Museum in Potsdam, Germany. Two Just Stop Oil protesters have meanwhile been charged with criminal damage offenses in the UK after they threw tomato soup on Vincent van Gogh's ""Sunflowers.""Responding to court Wednesday's ruling, Just Stop Oil Belgium, which is not affiliated with its British namesake, told Reuters by email: ""Isn't it ironic that climate activists who nonviolently oppose the mass slaughter of life on Earth are being condemned?""Top image: Visitors looks at Johannes Vermeer's painting ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" at the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague."|https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_50,ar_1:1/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F221103015136-02-vermeer-climate-protest.jpg

Guardado was killed June 18, 2020, as two Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies pursued him after he allegedly displayed a handgun, looked at the deputies and ran away from an auto body shop in the city of Gardena in Los Angeles County, officials said at the time of the shooting. Attorneys representing the Guardado family have disputed those claims.During the pursuit, deputy Miguel Vega fatally shot Guardado in the back five times, according to a family autopsy and the county coroner’s office. Guardado, who was Latino, was killed against the backdrop of social and political unrest that was sparked after the May 2020 murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by a White police officer in Minneapolis. Floyd’s murder led to national and global protests, decrying the racial injustice Black Americans and other communities of color face in police encounters. The shooting prompted the first inquest in Los Angeles in more than 30 years. The Medical Examiner-Coroner’s Office determined Guardado’s death was a homicide. Vega’s attorney Adam Marangell previously told CNN, “Guardado refused multiple commands not to reach for a gun, forcing deputy Vega to fire his weapon in fear for his life.”In an email Wednesday, Marangell told CNN, “Neither I nor Deputy Vega had knowledge of the settlement prior to it being announced.”The FBI and the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office are still investigating the shooting, according to the Guardado family attorneys and haven’t disclosed yet whether Vega or his partner on the day of the shooting “were within policy for their use of deadly force or if they will be disciplined and/or criminally charged for their actions,” the statement said.“Peace and justice will only come when the current investigations are completed, and Deputy Miguel Vega is held criminally responsible for Andrés’ death. We will forever be grateful to our attorneys, our community, and to all of those people who have raised their voices as advocates for justice for Andrés,” the statement from Guardado’s family said.CNN has reached out to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors for further comment.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/221102132915-02-andres-guardado-rally.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill
4|https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/asia/north-korea-missile-thursday-intl-hnk/index.html|North Korea fires presumed ICBM in failed test, South Korean source says|North Korea conducted the failed launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) Thursday, according to a South Korean government source, as Pyongyang intensified its battery of missile tests against a backdrop of US and South Korean military drills that had been scheduled to end on Friday.However, within hours of the presumed failed test, Washington and Seoul agreed to extend those large-scale exercises to an unknown date, according to a statement from the South Korean Air Force, which said “it was necessary to demonstrate a solid combined defense posture of the bilateral alliance under the current security crisis, heightened by North Korea’s provocations.”The joint exercises, named “Vigilant Storm,” began on Monday and involve 240 aircraft and “thousands of service members” from both countries, according to the US Defense Department.North Korea had objected to those drills in statements issued this week, before it ramped up tensions on the peninsula with a barrage of weapons tests on Wednesday and Thursday. The South Korean government source said the presumed Hwasong-17 ICBM succeeded in separating at the second stage, but is believed to have failed after that and fell into the sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.North Korea’s last presumed ICBM launch was on March 24, when a Hwasong-17 – its most advanced weapon to date – recorded Pyongyang’s highest and longest duration missile test on record, according to state media reports that closely matched Japanese estimates.North Korea followed the presumed ICBM test Thursday with two short-range ballistic missile launches, according to South Korea and Japan.In Japan, the presumed ICMB launch triggered warnings to take shelter in the northern Miyagi, Yamagata and Niigata prefectures, where the Japanese Prime Minister’s office initially said it was expected to fly over. Japan’s Defense Ministry later evaluated that the missile did not cross over Japan.Japan’s Defense Ministry said North Korea launched at least three ballistic missiles Thursday morning, including a possible ICBM.The possible ICBM was launched from the west coast of North Korea and flew about 750 kilometers (466 miles) at a maximum altitude of about 2,000 kilometers (1,242 miles) and fell into the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, east of the Korean Peninsula, the ministry said, adding it condemned North Korea’s actions.In a statement Thursday, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said Pyongyang’s repeated launches “of ballistic missiles are a serious provocation that harms the peace and stability of not only the Korean Peninsula but also the international community.” Thursday’s tests come just hours before US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is due to meet his South Korean counterpart Lee Jong-sup at the Pentagon. US National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement Thursday that Washington “strongly condemns” North Korea’s ballistic missile tests, saying they were a “flagrant violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions and needlessly raises tensions and risks destabilizing the security situation in the region.”The Hwasong-17 has been described by North Korean state media as a “powerful nuclear war deterrent.” It could, at least theoretically, put the entire US mainland in range of a North Korean nuclear warhead, but there’s a lot of unknowns about the missile’s capability to deliver a nuclear payload on target.It is, however, big enough to carry a nuclear weapon, or possibly several nuclear weapons, according to experts.Thursday’s launches take the count of North Korean missile tests to at least 30 so far this year, according to a CNN tally – though the count of individual missiles is far higher.The weapons fired include both cruise missiles and ballistic missiles, the latter of which have formed the large majority of North Korea’s tests this year.There are substantial differences between these two types of missiles.A ballistic missile is launched using a rocket or rockets, then travels outside of Earth atmosphere, gliding in space before reentry and then descending powered only by gravity to its target.A cruise missile is powered by a jet engine, stays inside Earth’s atmosphere during its flight and is maneuverable with control surfaces similar to an airplane’s.Cruise missiles have smaller payloads than ballistic missiles, so would require a smaller nuclear warhead than a missile designed to hit the mainland United States, such as an intercontinental ballistic missile.United Nations Security Council resolutions ban North Korea from testing ballistic missiles, but no such restriction applies to the testing of cruise missiles.North Korea’s ability to deploy a nuclear warhead on any kind of missile is unproven.On Wednesday, North Korea launched at least 23 short-range missiles of varying types to the east and west of the Korean Peninsula, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry.It was the highest number of North Korean short-range missiles fired in a single day, and included a ballistic missile that landed close to South Korean territorial waters for the first time since the division of Korea, according to the JCS.That missile hit international waters 167 kilometers (104 miles) northwest of South Korea’s Ulleung island, about 26 kilometers south of the Northern Limit Line (NLL) – the de facto inter-Korean maritime border that North Korea does not recognize.Seoul responded Wednesday by launching three air-to-surface missiles from F-15K and KF-16 fighter jets, targeting an area the same distance north of the NLL. North Korea is launching missiles at an “unprecedentedly high frequency,” Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters on Wednesday.US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield condemned North Korea’s unprecedented missile launch, telling CNN the UN would be “putting pressure” on China and Russia to improve and enhance such sanctions.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/150325082152-social-gfx-cnn-logo.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_898,w_1596,c_crop/h_270,w_480/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100

Cristian Javier started Game 4 in the series for the Astros, tossing six innings of no-hit ball, striking out nine and walking two. He threw 97 pitches before being relieved. Bryan Abreu and Rafael Montero each pitched a perfect inning before Ryan Pressly closed out the Phillies in the ninth at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia.With the win, the Astros even the best-of-seven series at two games apiece, scoring all of their runs in the fifth inning.Javier told FOX after the game, via a translator, “It’s funny. My parents told me today I was going to throw a no-hitter, and thanks to God, I was able to accomplish that.” Javier, who hails from the Dominican Republic, later told reporters his father arrived in the US yesterday and saw him pitch for the first time.Houston manager Dusty Baker said postgame that he was thinking of Javier and protecting his health when deciding to pull him after the sixth, noting Javier’s increasing pitch count and the strength of the Astros’ bullpen. “It’s always tough to take a guy out, but you have to weigh the no-hitter and history versus trying to win this game and get back to 2-2 in the World Series,” Baker said.The only previous no-hitter in 118 years of World Series history is Don Larsen’s perfect game in the 1956 World Series. The Astros now hold the distinction of throwing the first combined no-hitter in postseason history, according to Major League Baseball. The only other no-hitter in postseason history was tossed by Roy Halladay for the Phillies in the 2010 National League Divisional Series. Philadelphia manager Rob Thomson noted the Phillies had a no-hitter pitched against them by the New York Mets earlier this year, then won the next day. “These guys, they got a short memory. They’re going to go home tonight. They’re going to go to bed and come back in here tomorrow and prep and compete like they always do,” Thomson said.This is Houston’s second no-hitter this season. On June 25, Javier, Hector Neris and Pressly combined for one against the Yankees.Astros catcher Christian Vazquez said of the Game 4 performance that he did not think of completing the no-hitter until “maybe the last inning” due to the potent Phillies lineup, which slugged their way to a Game 3 victory Tuesday.“We’ve not finished the job yet, but this is very, very special for us. And when we get old we’re going to remember this,” Vazquez said.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220210151556-travis-caldwell.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100
6|https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/03/asia/seoul-halloween-friends-missing-intl-hnk-dst/index.html|‘He was curious about the world’: Friends remember American student killed in Seoul Halloween disaster|When he arrived in the South Korean city of Seoul in late August, American exchange student Steven Blesi quickly developed a wide circle of friends from around the world.The 20-year-old from Atlanta was studying at the city’s Hangyang University, as part of a US study abroad program. He had planned to meet up with several people from the course on Saturday in the Itaewon district of Seoul, to celebrate Halloween with thousands of other young revelers.But when he didn’t show up, his friends and family began a frantic search to track him down, before eventually learning that he had died in the crowd crush in an overcrowded alleyway which killed 156 mostly young people.Blesi’s best friend on the program was Ian Chang, 21, from Florida, who was also his neighbor in their university dorms.“We pretty much like adventures, doing spontaneous stuff,” Chang told CNN in an exclusive interview this week. “And just exploring the city.”Blesi loved “dancing, drinking, having fun,” Chang said, and “every time he met someone new, he had a big impact on them.”On Saturday night, Chang and Blesi were supposed to meet in the narrow streets of Itaewon, a popular district lined with nightclubs, bars and fast food outlets. The pair had been together earlier that day, then Chang had gone home to get changed.“At the beginning we just wanted to go to Itaewon to see how it was, see what’s so special about Halloween there,” Chang said. “Because we heard from people (that) Itaewon is going to be big on Halloween.”But when he arrived in Itaewon around 9:40 p.m., Chang began to realize the danger that was unfolding. He sent Blesi a Snapchat message at 10:17 p.m. urging him to avoid Itaewon, and to meet up in the neighborhood of Hongdae instead.“It’s too packed. And there’s no place to go,” Chang’s message said.As news spread of the horror that unfolded in the Itaewon alleyway over the next few hours, Blesi’s other friends also tried calling and messaging him.“You can come to my place … it’s safe here. Where are you Steven?” messaged 24-year-old Belgian exchange student, Wassim Essebane, at around 1 a.m. on Sunday via KakaoTalk, a South Korean messaging app similar to WhatsApp.Another friend, Stefanie Reuss, 22, was also trying to track Blesi down from her home more than 8,000 kilometers (4,970 miles) away in Austria. Reuss helped to raise the alarm, by posting messages on Instagram and Twitter trying to find him.One of the people Reuss contacted was 19-year-old Olivia Kim from Houston, Texas, who had been dating Blesi for a few weeks. Kim had been planning to go to Itaewon on Saturday night, but changed plans at the last minute. She was due to go on a date with Blesi on Sunday afternoon. “Steven and I have been talking to each other nearly everyday for about a month after going on our first date in early October,” Kim told CNN. “I immediately adored his emotional generosity, wit, adventurous spirit, and optimistic personality.”Kim had lost contact with Blesi on Saturday, and when he still didn’t respond on Sunday morning, she began to worry that he was one of the victims.Back home in Atlanta, Blesi’s father, Steve, was also growing increasingly desperate. “Maybe a half hour before this tragedy took place, I texted him in WhatsApp … ‘I know you’re out and about. Stay safe. I love you.’ And I never got a response back,” Blesi’s father said.Over the next few hours, the repeated missed calls and messages went unanswered.At around 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, Chang said Blesi’s mother had emailed him, looking for help in tracking down her son. Chang said they tried to call around the hospitals in Seoul, enlisting their Korean-speaking friends to help.But around midday on Sunday, they all learned the news they feared the most, after being told by Blesi’s father, who had been informed by the US embassy.Another American student from the program, 20-year-old Anne Gieske from Kentucky, also died in the crowd crush on Saturday night. She had been with Blesi earlier in the evening, although it’s not clear if they were together when they died. Earlier in the evening, the young partygoers had thought the overpacked streets in the Itaewon district of Seoul were part of the fun of the Halloween experience.“At the beginning we thought it was funny,” said Anne-Lou Chevalier, a 22-year-old French exchange student who survived the crowd crush. “We heard Halloween in Itaewon was amazing.”But when an estimated 100,000 people eventually crammed into the narrow lanes and alleyways, panic began to set in.“We (started) to be very, very stuck together and crushed, and then we heard some people screaming and crying,” Chevalier said.“We were trying to help people, because there were a lot of people (who) couldn’t breathe,” said her friend 18-year-old Alice Sannier, also from France.The friends got separated in the chaos of the crowd, and Chevalier fainted twice in the crush, adding that it felt “like dying.”“I remember that I had no air, so I started suffocating,” Chevalier said. “Somehow I got evacuated with my friend, so I’m very, very lucky.”The two friends said their slight frames made them more vulnerable. “Because we are small in size, there (were) a lot of foreigners that were (much) taller and they were surrounding us, so at one point you cannot have some air, and then you start to freak out,” Chevalier said.In total, 101 women and 55 men were killed in the disaster.Sannier and several other eyewitnesses who spoke to CNN said that they saw multiple people pushing into the crowd, which is being investigated as a possible trigger for the domino effect that took place.“Everyone was pushing, that’s why so many people were dying,” Sannier said, adding that they didn’t see any police officers when they were in the packed alleyway.Records show eleven calls had been made to police to warn about the situation in Itaewon before the crush happened on Saturday evening, and the head of South Korea’s National Police Agency has said that the police response to those calls was “inadequate.” An investigation is underway.Friends and families of the victims are only just beginning to process what happened to their loved ones, many of whom were just starting out in life.“It is unimaginable,” Reuss told CNN.Reuss had met Blesi when she spent three weeks traveling in Seoul in September. They had quickly become friends, partying together and doing karaoke and eating Korean barbecue, and they were making plans to travel together in Europe.“He was curious about the world,” Reuss said. “He had so many dreams. I am very similar to him. It makes me sad.”Blesi’s father said his son had “always been an adventurer.” He was an Eagle Scout, liked basketball and wanted to learn multiple languages, he said.“He had an incredibly bright future that is now gone,” he added.One of Blesi and Chang’s most recent adventures was a hiking trip a few weeks ago, to the mountainous island of Jeju off the southwest coast of South Korea.“We (were) just all impressed by how far we’ve been from home,” Chang said. “Going on all these adventures together. And exploring something that we probably haven’t thought of a year ago.”As well as hiking and enjoying the food and nightlife of South Korea, Blesi also loved its cultural traditions.“He’d never been to Asia so he really wanted to explore,” Chang said. “He was really excited to go into, for example, temples.”His friend Essebane told CNN that Blesi was “an absolute great guy.”“He was kind, open, made you feel comfortable, had such a warm personality, and he was funny,” Essebane said. “I’ll never forget about him.”In only a few months of knowing each other, Chang said he had come to think of Blesi as his “brother.”“Steven was the kindest person there ever was,” Chang said.“I’m just glad to have had him in my life,” he added. “I wish I could have made more memories with him.”|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/221103111345-screengrab-blesi-and-chang.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_850,c_fill

8|https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/03/politics/arizona-election-deniers-kari-lake-obama-midterms/index.html|Warnings about a fragile democracy hit home for some Arizona voters as election deniers compete for key offices|The voters who poured into a Phoenix high school to hear from former President Barack Obama were looking to send a message of defiance Wednesday night. They said they are determined to defeat former President Donald Trump’s hand-picked slate of election deniers – including gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake, Senate nominee Blake Masters and Secretary of State nominee Mark Finchem – and will not allow their state’s voters to be intimidated by activists who turned up to monitor ballot drop boxes late last month – some of them armed, masked and wearing camouflage. As President Joe Biden warned Americans from Washington, DC, on Wednesday night that democracy is at stake, it’s here in Arizona that democratic institutions look most fragile ahead of next week’s midterm elections and the 2024 presidential election, in which Arizona is likely to be a pivotal battleground. Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who successfully defeated Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, now finds herself locked in a tight race against Lake, who has said she will accept the results of a “fair, honest and transparent election,” after previously refusing in an interview with CNN to commit to accepting the results if she lost. And Finchem, who could become the state’s chief elections administrator, is still trying to overturn the results of the last election. “If you do need one more reason to vote, consider the fact that our democracy is on the ballot. And nowhere is that clearer than here in Arizona,” Obama told the crowd Wednesday, later adding that “democracy as we know it may not survive in Arizona” if election deniers fill all the top state offices.  Maricopa County was the site of repeated “audits” after the 2020 election – including the sham partisan review conducted by the now-defunct firm known as Cyber Ninjas. Both political parties are now girding for another potential battle over the election results in a state Biden won by less than 10,500 votes. And the GOP candidates at the top of the ticket are setting that tone. Joann Rodriguez, a registered Democrat from Maricopa County, said it was scary that “radical Republicans” in her state were able to elevate candidates like Lake and Masters, who won their primaries in part by echoing Trump’s falsehoods about the 2020 election. “What are they running on, aside from Trump’s talking points that the election was stolen?” Rodriguez said. She noted that “a lot of Trumpers” are still driving their trucks with Trump flags around her Glendale, Arizona, neighborhood. “And they’re walking around with guns on their hips, showing up at the ballot boxes or showing up at the election sites – for what reason? I mean, do they think that their intimidation tactics are going to work?” Hobbs touted her record as secretary of state Wednesday night. “I stood for democracy when I refused to give into the insurrectionists who surrounded my home after I certified the 2020 election and I’m still doing it today in this race for governor,” she said. A New York Times/Siena College poll released this week showed her in a dead heat race with Lake. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the race a Toss-up.The state was on edge as Obama arrived in Arizona less than a week before the midterm election to campaign for fellow Democrats, including Sen. Mark Kelly, who is in a close race with Masters. The fact that those top statewide contests may be decided on a razor’s edge is what brought Obama to the Grand Canyon State as he seeks to fire up the Democratic base and make sure that young voters and Latino voters – who will be critical to victory in Arizona – turn out in a midterm election year. Both Biden and Obama have been arguing that the fate of democracy is at stake, but Biden, who has not been invited to campaign in top swing states, had to make his argument from the opposite side of the country.The political climate and concerns about the sanctity of the election results are what brought Keith Greenberg, a registered Republican from Maricopa County, to Obama’s rally. He said in an interview that he wasn’t voting for Democrats in this election, he is voting against the Trump ticket.  “The Republican Party today is not the Republican Party I’m a part of,” said Greenberg, who described the 2020 election as fair and honest. “That’s more like the American Nazi Party and I can’t put up with that – the lie.”  If the Trump ticket wins, Greenberg said, “It means that the state of Arizona has lost its mind. And this is no longer a safe place to live. If Mark Finchem wins and says, ‘Well, I don’t care what the people voted. I’m going to do this’ – then what’s the point? We’ve lost our democracy.” Arizona’s status as a tinderbox of election controversies is underscored by the fact that two lawsuits have already been filed in federal court on behalf of voters who felt intimidated by the aggressive patrols at ballot drop boxes late last month.  Voters filed complaints to the Arizona Secretary of State’s Office after some activists were taking pictures of voters and their license plates – apparently inspired by debunked conspiracy theories about so-called “mules” who stuffed ballot boxes in 2020. A federal judge issued a ruling in one of the cases on Tuesday barring members of a group known as Clean Elections USA – whose leader has falsely asserted the 2020 election was rigged – from openly carrying guns or wearing body armor within 250 feet of drop boxes.  Because of the ruling, the group’s members are also now barred from speaking to or yelling at voters who drop off their ballots, and they may not photograph or film voters at the drop boxes. The Justice Department had weighed in on the case that was brought by the League of Women Voters. The DOJ did not formally take sides, but in a legal brief, federal prosecutors said the right-wing group’s “vigilante ballot security efforts” were likely illegal and “raise serious concerns of voter intimidation.”  The depth of the belief among Republicans about Trump’s election lies was underscored by a CNN poll  conducted by SSRS that was released on Wednesday: 66% of Republicans said they don’t believe Biden legitimately won the election. That dynamic is even more pronounced in a state like Arizona where Trump acolytes control the Republican Party and have censured figures like outgoing Republican Gov. Doug Ducey and former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for what they said was insufficient loyalty to the former president.  Michelle Gonzales, a registered Democrat from Maricopa County, said she believes that people came to see Obama Wednesday night “so they could feel hopeful” about the democratic process amid all the noise.   “With everything, all the rhetoric going on, I think it’s important to really hear from someone – that we trust and we believe in – that we can be hopeful about this election,” she said. “You can see all these people out here. Thousands of people waiting. I just want to believe that people want to believe in something better – that they have morals and values that we all should have as human beings and not elect these liars and con people.” |https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/141231145448-maeve-reston.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100
9|https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/03/health/dry-shampoo-lab-testing/index.html|Independent lab finds ‘troubling’ levels of cancer-causing chemical in more types of dry shampoo products, report alleges|High levels of benzene, a cancer-causing chemical, have been detected in more brands and batches of dry shampoo products, according to a new report from Valisure, an independent laboratory.Just last month, certain aerosol dry shampoos – including some Dove, Nexxus, Suave, TIGI and TRESemmé products – were voluntarily recalled because of the potential presence of benzene. Then on Monday, Valisure sent a citizen petition to the US Food and Drug Administration in which the lab described that among 148 batches from 34 different brands of dry shampoo products, 70% of samples tested showed “quantifiable” levels of benzene.According to their report, 11 samples showed levels over 10 times more than 2 parts per million (ppm), the FDA limit for drugs. “However, the dry shampoos tested are not drugs and contain no active pharmaceutical ingredient for therapeutic purpose; therefore, any significant detection of benzene could be deemed unacceptable. Furthermore, Valisure shows data from the analysis of benzene by directly sampling contaminated air after spraying dry shampoo products, which suggests potential for short- and long-term inhalation exposure to high levels of benzene. The presence of this known human carcinogen in dry shampoo products that are regularly used indoors and in large volumes makes this finding especially troubling,” David Light, Valisure’s chief executive officer, and Qian Wu, Valisure’s head of global analytics, wrote in the FDA Citizen Petition.The petition urges the FDA to “expeditiously request recalls” on the affected batches of products containing benzene and better define limits for benzene contamination in other products.The FDA normally takes 180 days to respond to a citizen petition.In summary, three lots of dry shampoo products from one brand contained spray with more than 100 ppm of benzene, according to the petition, and some samples tested by Valisure showed more than 10 times the FDA drug limit. The petition also mentions that Valisure has detected benzene in other commonly used products as well, including certain hand sanitizers and sunscreens.CNN contacted the brands listed in the petition and reached out to the FDA for comment but did not immediately hear back.“The detection of high levels of benzene in dry shampoos should be cause for significant concern since these products are likely used indoors, where benzene may linger and be inhaled for prolonged periods of time,” Light said in a news release Tuesday. “These and other issues identified by Valisure, including the detection of benzene in body spray, hand sanitizer, and sunscreen products, strongly underscore the importance of independent testing and its need to be better integrated into an increasingly complex and vulnerable global supply chain.”Last year, several deodorants and sunscreen products were recalled due to detections of benzene.Benzene is formed from both natural and man-made processes. “Natural sources of benzene include volcanoes and forest fires. Benzene is also a natural part of crude oil, gasoline, and cigarette smoke,” according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “The main way people are exposed is by breathing in air containing benzene,” according the American Cancer Society.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/191113192527-jacqueline-howard.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100

Here’s what you can focus on instead|It’s no longer a secret that single-use plastic is harming the planet. Not only does the process of creating these materials emit enormous amounts of planet-warming gases, but they also can take centuries to decompose in a landfill.So as demand for climate action escalates and the dangers of plastics become more evident, consumers are turning to so-called compostable and biodegradable alternatives for things like food containers, cups, plates, cutlery and bags, in hopes of mitigating further climate and environmental harms.  But unfortunately, researchers say those products are also a problem.  A new study conducted in the UK found that 60% of products labeled as compostable do not fully break down in home compost. And unlike conventional plastics, these alternatives are largely unregulated, despite their advertised benefits. “In the lab, where [these plastics] have been tested and have been paid for by a manufacturer, they behaved in one way and they’ve been determined to be compostable in a home composter,” Danielle Purkiss, researcher and lead author of the study, told CNN. “But what’s happened is we’ve seen a lot of these pieces of packaging with certification still don’t break down in these different home composting conditions.” The study shows “there’s a problem with the lab testing versus the real-world conditions where these materials are being disposed,” Purkiss told CNN.Although compostable and biodegradable packaging and flatware are touted as being environmentally friendly, they are still resource- and energy-intensive to produce, according to Judith Enck, a former Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator and now president of Beyond Plastics, a non-profit focused on research and consumer education.In addition to the greenhouse gases released from industrial facilities making these products, the crops used as feedstock, such as corn or sugar beets, also require significant amounts of fossil fuels, farmland and water to create them — all resources that could instead go to actual food, Enck said. Though compostables are still slightly better than conventional plastics, Enck told CNN, “people shouldn’t fool themselves into thinking that it actually gets composted.”“There’s a bit of greenwashing going on here,” she added.Researchers say the messaging has not been clear around how sustainable these compostable options are. One of the key findings of the report, Purkiss said, is that people are confused and don’t know the meaning of the labels on compostable and biodegradable plastic items.  The bottom line is that companies still use some fossil fuels in these products, yet continue to market them as sustainable, which leads to improper disposal of plastic waste. Biodegradable plastic for instance, while bio-based, can still be made at least in part with fossil fuels. Ultimately, compostable products are designed to fully decompose only at industrial compost facilities that regulate the temperature to achieve peak composting efficiency. But most of these products don’t wind up there, Enck and Purkiss said – they end up at regular landfills, where they will persist for years, just like conventional plastics. Or they will be burned in trash incinerators, where they release methane, a potent greenhouse gas. “It pains me to say this because I want non-plastic alternatives to work,” Enck said, “but there really is no such thing as biodegradable plastics, and compostable packaging really only gets composted at high-temperature composting facilities.” Experts who spoke to CNN said the fact that people are already willing to move away from single-use plastics into more sustainable options is a great first step. And there are other ways you can reduce your impact. Purkiss and fellow researchers at the University College London designed a citizen-science study in which more than 1,600 participants in the UK so far have voluntarily experimented with home composting. Purkiss said other people can also take part in the “Big Compost Experiment” to help scientists learn more about the impact of these products. Purkiss also said it’s important for consumers to vote with their wallets. “A citizen has lots of ways they can affect change, and one way they can really influence behavior is through their buying decisions,” Purkiss said. “They need to put pressure on manufacturers and business to move towards more properly sustainable models.” Here are some more ways to reduce the amount of plastic in your everyday life: Skip biodegradable plastic — It’s a misnomer, Enck said. Instead, use reusable or refillable items when you can, or opt for packaging that’s made from recycled material and can easily be recycled.  Have reusables and refillables ready — Bring reusable bags when you go to the grocery store, not just for all your items but also for your favorite produce. Use refillable mugs or thermos cups for your coffee or tea while on the go, and same goes for a refillable water bottle.  Choose paper (or no) packaging over plastic — If you’re looking at two versions of the same product and one is packaged in paper or cardboard and the other is in plastic, then the choice is obvious. For food or take-outs at restaurants, opt for aluminum packaging that can be recycled instead.  Bring your own cutlery or to-go containers — Enck takes her own utensils and reusable containers to restaurants that usually serve food in single-use plastic. Not all restaurants will allow this, she said, but it’s important to support the ones that do.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220912114035-life-but-greener-logo-large-169.png?q=h_289,w_1600,x_0,y_0/w_1280
