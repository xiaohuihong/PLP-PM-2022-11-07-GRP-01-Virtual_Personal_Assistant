https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/31/opinions/brazil-election-bolsonaro-lula-trump-division-wierson/index.html|Opinion: Brazil bids farewell to its ‘Trump of the Tropics.’ Now the hard work begins|This Sunday more than 150 million Brazilians went to the polls to vote in a run-off presidential election in which former President Luiz Inácio ‘Lula’ da Silva posted a stunning political comeback.Lula beat incumbent President Jair Bolsonaro with 50.9% of the vote against Bolsonaro’s 49.1% – a difference of roughly two million of the eligible votes cast.It was a nail-biter of an election with the final result coming only after nearly all of the votes from the country’s 577,000 electronic voting machines had been tabulated.On one hand, Lula’s victory marked a sharp rebuke of Bolsonaro’s irreverent and often-times controversial governing style, which earned him the derisive moniker as the ‘Trump of the Tropics.’Not only was Bolsonaro in fact endorsed by former US President Donald Trump, but like Trump, he was widely criticized for his handling of the coronavirus which resulted in nearly 700,000 deaths in the country, according to the World Health Organization.Moreover, Bolsonaro’s aggressive anti-LGBT agenda, decidedly anti-environmental policies and authoritarian tendencies made him something of a pariah in the international media. Lula, who previously served two terms as president from 2003 to 2010, also brought his fair share of baggage to this election. In fact, if it were not for his conviction being annulled on a jurisdictional technicality for his role in “Operation Car Wash” – one of the largest public corruption scandals in the world – Lula would still be serving out his 12-year prison sentence.His detractors have feared that his return to public office might usher in a new wave of large-scale graft and inefficiency with Brazil’s economically relevant state-owned companies.Not since the end of the military dictatorship in the 1980s have Brazilians been faced with two more starkly contrasting candidates, each with diametrically opposing political outlooks for the country.And with Lula winning by a little over two million votes while around five million votes were purposely left blank or spoiled by voters, it’s clear that a sizable percentage of the voting population didn’t buy into either of their visions for the country.Although it’s still early, fears that Bolsonaro might not accept the results or even stage a coup are quickly dissipating as even pro-Bolsonaro conservative media is accepting the results.That’s the good news. The bad news is that, now come January 1, when Lula is sworn in for his third term as President, he will have to find a way to govern a country that is deeply divided and highly mistrustful of the other side.Unlike in his past victories where Lula came into office with a clear mandate, winning over 60% of the votes in both 2002 and 2006, this time not only did Lula eke out a the slimmest of victories, but he will face a congress that is still very much aligned with Bolsonaro.In fact, in the first-round election in early October, allies of the current president took a plurality of seats in both the lower chamber as well as the Senate.Moreover, with the down-ballot results of Sunday’s run-off elections for governorships across the country, it’s clear that allies of Bolsonaro will be in power in 14 of Brazil’s 27 states including the most economically important states of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais.And it’s in this context that Lula will have to confront seismic challenges on multiple fronts. Brazil has been in something of an economic freefall since the onset of the pandemic and has yet to fully recover.Hunger has reemerged as a pressing social concern while racial inequities have been exacerbated in recent years. Urban violence continues to terrorize cities across the country and systemic corruption is still rampant.Perhaps most importantly for the rest of the world, Brazil’s role in the fight against global warming is undeniable – the country is home to a large part of the Amazon rainforest. Under Bolsonaro, deforestation of the Amazon surged. Lula meanwhile, highlighted the need to protect the rainforest in his victory speech, saying his administration would “fight for zero deforestation.”That said, mobilizing the requisite political force needed to address these issues in this country of 215 million will be anything but easy.But if there is a silver lining to Lula’s victory it is that both regional powers and financial markets seem to be willing to extend a hand in helping the incoming president as he pursues his governing agenda.Lula will be embraced with open arms by many of Latin America’s leftist leaders who have been propelled to victory in recent years, as well as across global financial markets where investors are cautiously bullish on the growth prospects of a Lula-led Brazil.Lula would be wise to lean into these international partnerships as he begins to form a government.But perhaps most importantly, Lula’s success – and that of the country as well – will likely hinge on the president’s well-honed political skills and his ability to extend an olive branch to key political leaders who supported Bolsonaro as he looks to build a coalition that can help him bring his political agenda to fruition.There is already talk on Brazil’s right about impeaching Lula – a very real possibility with ample historical precedent given that two of out of the eight presidents Brazil has had since the country’s return to democracy in the 1985 were removed from office before the end of their terms.The stakes are high for Brazil. And the stakes are high for Lula, not only politically but personally as well.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/221031123346-screengrab-lula-speech.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_850,c_fill
https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/30/asia/india-bridge-collapse-intl/index.html|Collapsed India bridge that killed 134 was recently repaired, official says|The death toll has risen to 134 after a suspension bridge collapsed in India’s western state of Gujarat on Sunday, as authorities revealed the structure had only recently reopened following repairs.Gujarat Home Minister Harsh Sanghavi said Monday some 200 people are estimated to have been on the bridge in the town of Morbi when it collapsed into the river below on Sunday evening. A cable at one end appears to have snapped, he added. The victims include 30 children, district officials told CNN on Monday.A total of 170 people have been rescued so far, according to Vishal Kanjaria, an administrative official for Morbi district. Some remain in hospital and others have returned home, though an exact breakdown is not yet known.The state of Gujarat has lodged a criminal complaint against the agency that was handling the maintenance of the 230-meter long bridge, which was built in the 19th century and reopened last week after renovations, he said.Photos from the scene Monday showed people gathering on the bank of the river Machchhu beside the mangled metal walkway, which hung at a sharp angle into the water, where rescue workers in inflatable dinghies searched for survivors.A five-person special investigation committee has been established to investigate the incident, Sanghavi said, amid an ongoing search and rescue operation by hundreds of personnel from state and national disaster relief teams and the Indian military.Speaking at a news conference in the early hours of Monday, Sanghavi did not say how many people are missing, but social media video showed dozens in the water following the collapse of the bridge.TV footage showed people holding the cables and remains of the bridge as emergency teams tried to reach them, Reuters reported. Some climbed up the wrecked structure to reach the river banks, while others swam to safety.Speaking later on Monday, senior police official Ashok Yadav said seven of the injured are still in hospital, while 56 people have been discharged after receiving treatment.The families of the victims will receive compensation from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund, according to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Speaking Monday at a campaign event ahead of a state-level election in Gujarat, Modi said his “heart is filled with love and is with the families of those suffering.”“The state government has set up a committee to investigate the incident. I assure the people of the country that there will be nothing lacking in the relief and rescue efforts,” Modi said.Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel said he was heading to Morbi and the state government would provide the equivalent of about $5,000 in compensation per family of the deceased and about $600 each for the injured.“I express my condolences to the families of the citizens who lost their lives in the tragedy,” he tweeted.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/221030235037-india-gujarat-bridge-screengrab.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_850,c_fill
https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/31/health/rainbow-fentanyl-halloween-candy-scare-wellness-partner/index.html|Is the threat of ‘rainbow fentanyl’ candy just another scary Halloween rumor?|Every year around the middle of October, reporters start contacting me wanting to talk about rumors of contaminated Halloween treats.That’s because I track media coverage of reported incidents of trick-or-treaters receiving razor blades in apples or pins and poison in candy bars. My data goes back to 1958, and my principal finding is simple: I can’t find any evidence that any child has ever been killed or seriously injured by a contaminated treat picked up in the course of trick-or-treating.READ MORE: A brief history of poisoned Halloween candy panicThis often surprises people who assume that Halloween sadism is both very real and very common.Stories about contaminated treats are best understood as contemporary legends. They’re tales we’ve all heard, that we’ve been assured are true. They warn that we live in a dangerous world filled with villainous strangers who could harm us if we aren’t careful.This year, reporters began reaching out earlier than usual, in late September, and they wanted to talk about a new alleged threat: “rainbow fentanyl.”Fentanyl is a very powerful synthetic opioid that has caused thousands of overdoses and deaths over the past two decades. In August 2022, drug enforcement authorities noted that pills containing fentanyl were being manufactured in various colors. DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said, “Rainbow fentanyl – fentanyl pills and powder that come in a variety of bright colors, shapes and sizes – is a deliberate effort by drug traffickers to drive addiction amongst kids and young adults.”Many news outlets covered this story, including the notion that the colors might be some sort of marketing ploy to attract younger drug users. But then some people started connecting rainbow fentanyl to Halloween.READ MORE: Vampire myths originated with a real blood disorder Interviewed on Fox News on Sept. 20, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel declared, “Every mom in the country is worried, what if this gets into my kid’s Halloween basket?” Other Fox commentators suggested that parents might want to protect their children by not letting them go trick-or-treating this year. And, to prove the bipartisan appeal of protecting children, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, repeated the warnings.It’s worth considering what’s familiar and what’s new about these warnings.One fairly standard element is commentators’ readiness to link September crime news to the possibility that it might presage what could happen on Halloween.In 1982 there was a spate of Tylenol poisonings – seven people died after purchasing and consuming tampered packages of pills. Many commentators then warned that parents needed to be extra vigilant when examining Halloween treats. Those deaths also led to a dramatic increase in protective packaging for all sorts of products to discourage tampering.Similarly, the 9/11 terrorist attacks led to rumors about Halloween 2001 threats – that there were plans to attack a mall where some parents let their children go trick-or-treating, or that terrorists had purchased massive amounts of candy, presumably so they could poison the treats before distributing them.READ MORE: From Black Death to Covid-19, pandemics have always pushed people to honor death and celebrate lifeTrends in recreational or illicit drug use often make the jump to Halloween warnings. In 2014, the year that Colorado first allowed state-licensed retail sales of recreational marijuana, the Denver Police Department posted online warnings that parents ought to keep an eye out for THC-laced edible candies in Halloween treats. Yet after Halloween had passed, a department spokesperson admitted, “We are not aware of any cases of children ingesting marijuana candy during Halloween season.”Similarly, in 2019, September reports of deaths caused by vaping black-market THC-infused cartridges were coupled with news that Pennsylvania authorities had confiscated commercial THC candies – supposedly smuggled from a state where they could be purchased legally – to generate another round of Halloween warnings.One obvious hole in these concerns is that drugs tend to cost more than candy – marijuana edibles, for example, run somewhere in the neighborhood of a dollar or two per dose or more.Fentanyl is considerably more expensive. It is not unreasonable to wonder just what a fentanyl dealer’s overarching goal might be if in passing the drug off as candy. The suggestion that a school-age kid would go from accidental user of fentanyl to a paying addict is far-fetched.Of course, the villains in contemporary legends aren’t expected to behave rationally. Ask why gang members would attempt to kill motorists who blink their headlights at them – an urban legend from the 1980s – and the response is likely to be, “That’s just the sort of thing those sadistic people do.” It might not make any sense for someone to give a brightly colored opioid pill or THC-infused candy to a small child, but it isn’t impossible, is it? Such reasoning is thought to justify ringing the alarm bells.READ MORE: How the ancient world’s scented sorceresses influence ideas about magic today Often there is a kernel of truth to these fears. Certainly fentanyl is a dangerous drug. But American history can be read as a long line of fears about witches, immigrants, drugs, conspirators and so on. These fears emerge as reflections of current social changes. Yes, things are always changing, and this can always frighten some people. But it is also true that, in retrospect, these fears are usually exaggerated.What seems new about describing rainbow fentanyl as a Halloween danger is the willingness of important political figures and news media outlets to spread the warnings. Most past claims about Halloween sadism lack such prominent spokespeople.But in a time when many news outlets seem intent on maintaining their audiences by frightening them, and increased political polarization seems to stall efforts to devise workable social policies, calls for protecting our children from the threats of boogeyman drug dealers return us to the spirit of Halloween: offering up fresh ways to keep people scared.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/tc-stacked-eng.png
https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/30/business/musk-tweet-pelosi-conspiracy/index.html|Elon Musk, Twitter’s new owner, tweets conspiracy theory about attack on Paul Pelosi|Elon Musk on Sunday gave credence to a fringe conspiracy theory about the violent attack on Paul Pelosi.The new Twitter owner tweeted a link to an article full of baseless claims about Pelosi. The article was posted on a website that purports to be a news outlet.Musk, who has 112 million followers on the platform he now owns, posted the baseless story about Pelosi in response to a tweet from Hilary Clinton at 8:15 am ET. He later deleted the tweet around 2 pm, but not before racking up more than 28,000 retweets and 100,000 likes.Linking to a Los Angeles Times story about Pelosi’s alleged attacker, Clinton wrote, “The Republican Party and its mouthpieces now regularly spread hate and deranged conspiracy theories. It is shocking, but not surprising, that violence is the result. As citizens, we must hold them accountable for their words and the actions that follow.”In response, Musk linked to the baseless story, and wrote, “There is a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye.”In 2016 the same website falsely claimed that Clinton had died and that the person on the presidential campaign trail was not Clinton but her body double. Musk’s post comes amid concerns about how the billionaire will run Twitter and if misinformation and hate will be given a bigger platform on the site. A Twitter spokesperson did not immediately return a CNN request for comment.Musk’s takeover — which was finalized Thursday night — not only has the potential to create upheaval for Twitter(TWTR) employees but also for the hundreds of millions of people around the world who use the platform daily. It could also impact the upcoming US midterm elections, if Musk makes good on his promise to restore the accounts of users who were previously banned from the platform, most notably former US President Donald Trump, and limit the company’s content restrictions.In the first weeks after agreeing to buy the company in April, and before his initial move to bail on the deal, Musk repeatedly stressed that his goal was to bolster “free speech” on the platform and work to “unlock” Twitter’s “extraordinary potential.” The Tesla CEO suggested he would rethink Twitter’s approach to content moderation and permanent bans, with potential impacts on civil discourse and the political landscape. He also talked about his desire to rid the platform of bots, even as he later made the number of bots central to his argument to abandon the deal.CNN’s Clare Duffy contributed to this report|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220913135321-oliver-darcy.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100
https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/28/middleeast/netanyahu-comeback-extremists-mime-intl/index.html|Netanyahu eyes extremist political support in comeback attempt|When Benjamin Netanyahu hits the campaign trail, he uses what’s been dubbed the Bibimobile – a converted truck turned into a travelling stage ensconced in bulletproof glass.         Elevated like a king above his subjects — who fawn over him as the one and only savior to lead Israel.    And with polls showing Netanyahu’s block of parties falling short of the needed 61-seat majority to form a government, the former prime minister has been taking the Bibi show around Israel to try and shore up every last one of his supporters ahead of the November 1 elections.   At a campaign stop last week in Kiryat Malachi, Netanyahu tells supporters from the Bibimobile: “Don’t be despondent, be turbocharged. Bring everybody at home and tell them this time don’t stay at home – go and vote.”   For the first time in more than 12 years, Netanyahu has been campaigning from the outside – as opposition leader. After four elections in three years failed to bring about a stable government, Netanyahu was toppled from his perch as the longest-serving prime minister by Naftali Bennett and current caretaker Prime Minister Yair Lapid, who formed an unlikely coalition of diverse parties.    Their coalition – made up of parties from the right wing to the left, and, for the first time, an Arab party – had consensus on few issues but all agreed Netanyahu needed to be out. But ultimately it was their diversity – and a few rebellious members – that brought about the coalition’s downfall and now, Israel’s fifth election in less than four years.    Netanyahu’s potential path back to power is a narrow one. The same political leaders who refused to work with him after the 2021 election – even if they fell into the same center-right ideological camp as Netanyahu – don’t seem any more likely to support him this year. That means Netanyahu will have to rely on parties further to the right in order to build a coalition, and the resulting government could reshape Israeli laws and society in a way no Israeli government has done before.  Polls suggest no bloc has a clear majority that could form a ruling government – but Netanyahu’s Likud party looks like it will be the biggest single party in the Knesset. Campaign advertisements on buses show Netanyahu pointing at the viewer, saying the path to the majority “is up to you!”     Netanyahu has been campaigning on the policies he championed when he was in power: safety and security, preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, supporting Jewish settlements in the West Bank, maintaining Israel’s military deterrence against enemies, and, in these tough economic times, reducing the cost of living.  But he himself may be the single biggest election issue.  His supporters – acting more like fans at a sporting event – eat it up.    One of them, jumping in front of the CNN camera, yells “Bibi is King of Israel! All people in the world is afraid of Bibi because the man is strong.”    And, it’s whether or not voters are afraid of what Netanyahu will do that will determine how they vote.  “We’re not talking about the future of the Israeli Palestinian conflict. We’re not really talking about cost of living, though Israel, like every other country is facing its own cost of living crisis,” said Anshel Pfeffer, The Economist and Haaretz correspondent who wrote a 2018 biography of Netanyahu called “Bibi: The Turbulent Life and Times of Benjamin Netanyahu.”  “We’re not talking about any other policy issue really, beyond Netanyahu and what Netanyahu will do on the day after the election,” he said.He’s also talking about reforming the judiciary.  Despite the ongoing campaign, Netanyahu is still in the midst of his corruption trial – where he faces one charge of bribery and three charges of fraud and breach of trust in three separate corruption investigations.   Netanyahu has pleaded not guilty and called his ongoing corruption trial a “witch hunt” and an “attempted coup” and has called for changes to Israel’s judiciary system.   Yohanan Plesner, a former member of the Israeli parliament and the president of the Israel Democracy Institute, said that if Netanyahu comes back to power, his first focus will be on using his majority to put a stop to the trial.   “His energy and focus will be on his trial, on eroding and undermining the independence, the independence of the judiciary, perhaps firing the Attorney General, those kinds of maneuvers that will allow him to free himself from the legal process that he’s facing,” Plesner said.    Plesner said the Israeli public’s debate about the future of Netanyahu is “entangled with a major debate about the features of Israeli democracy, how Israeli democracy should look like and the independence of the judiciary … the very nature and fundamental characteristics of our democracy.”   One of Netanyahu’s likely coalition allies, right-wing religious Zionist leader Bezalel Smotrich, has proposed a series of drastic legal reforms, seen by many critics as a clear way to undercut judicial independence, including dropping the ability to charge a public servant with fraud and breach of trust – a charge Netanyahu faces in his current trial.     Asked about the proposal by CNN’s Fareed Zakaria, Netanyahu demurred and said, “I wouldn’t do anything that affects me. I think my trial is unraveling as it is.”   Much of Netanyahu’s support in a future government would need to come from the extreme right wing.   The coalition would include a new joint group led by Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, an extremist who has been convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting racism.    He was known for hanging in his home a portrait of the Israeli man who massacred 29 Palestinians in 1994 before being beaten to death himself.    In 2020, Ben Gvir tweeted he would take the portrait down, ahead of the elections, “…for the sake of unity and the victory of the right,” he said.    Earlier this month, Ben Gvir inflamed already sky-high tensions in the flashpoint Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah by pulling a gun during clashes between Israelis and Palestinians, yelling at police to shoot Arabs who were throwing stones.    But polls show Smotrich and Ben Gvir’s joint party on the rise and could garner more than a dozen seats in the 120-seat Knesset – a showing many Israelis thought unfathomable just a few years ago –  becoming a key pillar of Netanyahu’s comeback attempt, and power.   Plesner said Netanyahu would once have “never dreamt of including such an extreme figure in his government,” but now he may need to appoint the once outcast Ben Gvir to a ministerial position.   “Now he has no choice. The more moderate Israeli politicians do not want anything to do with Mr. Netanyahu. And therefore he built partnerships [with] these really extreme right. We might expect to see Ben Gvir in the government. What kind of portfolio? What power will you have beyond a provocations and populism?” Plesner said.    Pfeffer told CNN that these extremists will extract a price from Netanyahu – that may include showing more favors towards West Bank settlers.   “The question is, what is the price that the far right is going to extricate from him? …. perhaps some settlements in the West Bank which were in the past abandoned by Israel, will be rebuilt, reoccupied?” Pfeffer said. “And perhaps further steps towards some type of annexation in the West Bank?”    All are moves that would likely inflame and escalate tensions with the Palestinians.    Just last year Netanyahu said Ben Gvir wasn’t fit to serve in the cabinet. But earlier this month, Netanyahu reversed himself, when asked if Ben Gvir would be a minister in his government.    “He certainly can, anyone can,” he said.    But Moshe Klughaft, an international political strategist who used to work with Netanyahu, said he doesn’t think the former PM will take extreme steps because a government with the likes of Ben Gvir will collapse quickly.    “He will not do significant movements like applying (sovereignty over) the territories or something like this. Netanyahu’s strategy is work for the short term, and then for another short term and another short term and not for the long term,” Klughaft told CNN. “So now he wants to win the elections, to gain 61 (seats). After this, he will want to establish a government and after this, I think he will want to go to another election as a caretaker prime minister.”   In his interview with CNN’s Zakaria, Netanyahu denied that the extremists will have any power.      “I’ve had such partners in the past, and they didn’t change an iota of my policies. I decide the policy with my party, which is the largest party by far in the country. And we are a center-right party and a responsible party, but we are not going to adopt norms for the government that we don’t agree with,” Netanyahu said.   But before he can decline such policy ideas, he’ll need to claw his way back to power, one parliamentary seat at a time.  Government supporters demonstrated outside the British embassy in Tehran to protest the UK government’s “role” in recent unrest in Iran, state-aligned news agency Tasnim said on Thursday. Tasnim said the student protesters accuse the UK of supporting BBC Persian and Iran International, networks that they say encourage anti-government demonstrations across the country.   “In recent weeks, several channels including Iran International, Manoto, BBC and Radiofarda have been officially teaching guerilla warfare and battle tactics” and “have formed a kind of media terrorism,” Tasnim said. Here’s the latest on this developing story: Iran’s Khamenei vows revenge after deadly attack on shrine Iran’s supreme leader promised on Thursday to retaliate against those threatening the country’s security after the massacre of Shiite pilgrims, an assault claimed by ISIS that threatens to inflame tensions amid widespread anti-government protests. “We all have a duty to deal with the enemy and its traitorous or ignorant agents,” Reuters cited Ali Khamenei as saying.  Top Israeli banker speaks at Saudi business forum in latest sign of thaw in ties Israel’s Bank Leumi would like to tap into investment opportunities in Saudi Arabia, Chairman Samer Haj Yehia told a business forum in Riyadh, which he is attending in the latest sign of a potential thawing in Saudi-Israeli relations, Reuters reported. “We can see that there’s a lot of investment going on, and we want to tap into that kind of investment, whether it’s on the payment side or on the retail side or on the cryptocurrency side,” Haj Yehia told a panel at the FII forum on Thursday. Israel and Lebanon teams sat around same table for maritime deal The Israeli and Lebanese negotiators of their maritime border agreement sat around the same table when finalizing the deal under United States and United Nations auspices, and after the US intermediary announced the deal was done, everyone clapped, Lior Haiat, head of the National Public Diplomacy Directorate in the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office told CNN Thursday.  Saudi Arabia’s Yasmeen Shabaan started her athletic journey by doing Ironman championships and then went on to become the first Saudi woman to complete a marathon. Watch her story here:  An Iranian hermit known as “the world’s dirtiest man” has died at the ripe old age of 94, just months after taking his first wash in decades, Iranian state media announced. “Amu Haji” – Uncle Haji – as he was referred to, died on Sunday in Dezhgah, a village in the country’s southern province of Fars, state news agency IRNA reported. According to the region’s district head, Haji had for decades avoided fresh food and believed that “if he cleans himself, he will get sick,” the agency reported. Haji was known for his staunch stance against bathing: A few years ago, when a group of villagers took him to a nearby river in an attempt to bathe him, he threw himself out of the car and ran away. Locals in the area all treated him and his condition with respect, IRNA reported, understanding that his fear of getting sick was the reason he avoided water. A few months ago, villagers successfully gave Haji a wash. Haji was unmarried. His funeral was held Tuesday evening in the nearby city of Farashband, according to IRNA.
