One of the missiles launched by Pyongyang was a short-range ballistic missile that landed close to South Korean territorial waters for the first time since the 1945 division, Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said. JCS said the missile landed in international waters 167 kilometers (104 miles) northwest of South Korea’s Ulleung island, about 26 kilometers south of the Northern Limit Line (NLL) – the de facto inter-Korean maritime border that North Korea does not recognize.Japan’s Defense Ministry said North Korea conducted another launch later on Wednesday, including at least one more ballistic missile toward the east that has fallen into the sea outside of Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).The ballistic missile flew a short distance at a maximum altitude of less than 50 km, Toshiro Ino, the deputy minister of defense, told reporters on Wednesday evening local time.“North Korea has rapidly escalated its provocations, launching more than a dozen missiles today alone and reportedly firing more than 100 artillery shells into the Japan sea since announcing an extremely provocative statement earlier in the day” Ino said.No damage to aircraft or vessels has been confirmed as of now.When asked whether North Korea had in the past launched this many missiles throughout a day, Ino told reporters that in 2006 and 2009 the North had fired several missiles throughout the day from 3 a.m. to 5 p.m. local time, and 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. local time, respectively, without mentioning an exact number of missiles.A South Korean defense official said earlier the missiles landed to the west of the peninsula in the Yellow Sea, known as the West Sea in Korea, and to the east in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea.An air raid warning on Ulleung island, located about 120 kilometers east of the peninsula, was lifted about 2 p.m. local time on Wednesday. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said the North Korean test was an “effective territorial encroachment.” At an emergency National Security Council (NSC) meeting, Yoon “ordered that a stern response be swiftly taken so that North Korea’s provocation pays a clear price,” according to South Korea’s presidential office.In an immediate response, South Korea launched three air-to-surface missiles from F-15K and KF-16 fighter jets on Wednesday morning, according to JCS.JCS said the South Korean Air Force targeted international waters north of the NLL at an equal distance to that which the North Korean missile had earlier landed south of the line.“Our military’s precise strike showed our will to firmly respond to any North Korean provocations including short-range ballistic missile, and our capability and readiness to precisely target the enemy,” JCS said.North Korea is “fully responsible” for the situation as they are the ones continuing to provoke despite warnings, JCS added.On Wednesday, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that North Korea is launching missiles at an “unprecedentedly high frequency.”Kishida also called for a National Security Council meeting to be held as soon as possible due to the rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula. “North Korea’s unprecedented launch of multiple ballistic missiles is recklessly threatening the security of the Republic of Korea,” Australian Foreign Affairs Minister, Penny Wong, tweeted on Wednesday.“Pyongyang must cease this action,” she added.Moscow urged North and South Korea to avoid steps that “could provoke a further increase in tension,” as it contends with fractured global relations amid Russian President Vladimir Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. “The situation is already very tense on the peninsula, and we urge everyone to remain calm and avoid steps that could provoke a further increase,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday.US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield condemned North Korea’s unprecedented missile launch overnight.Thomas-Greenfield told CNN on This Morning with Don Lemon, Kaitlan Collins and Poppy Harlow that the launch breaks “multiple Security Council resolutions” and said the UN would be “putting pressure” on China and Russia to improve and enhance such sanctions.She declined to say whether US President Joe Biden would raise it with China’s President Xi at the G20, but added it was “on the President’s mind.”The launch is North Korea’s 29th this year, according to a CNN count, and comes after a North Korean official warned in  a statement earlier Wednesday that the United States and South Korea would pay the “most horrible price in history” for any military action against Pyongyang.The aggressive acceleration in weapons testing and rhetoric has sparked alarm in the region, with the US, South Korea and Japan responding with missile launches and joint military exercises.On Monday, the United States and South Korea began previously scheduled large-scale military exercises called “Vigilant Storm.”The maneuvers involve 240 aircraft and “thousands of service members” from both countries, according to the US Defense Department.US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is scheduled to meet with his South Korean counterpart Lee Jong-sup at the Pentagon on Thursday.Experts have previously told CNN that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un could be sending a message by deliberately showcasing the nation’s arsenal during a period of heightened global conflict.Last month, North Korean state media broke six months of silence over this year’s spate of missile tests, claiming they were meant to demonstrate Pyongyang’s readiness to fire tactical nuclear warheads at potential targets in the South.The latest tests also come after the head of the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog warned last week that Pyongyang could be preparing for a nuclear test – its first since 2017 – with satellite imagery showing activity at its underground nuclear test site.“We are following this very, very closely. We hope it doesn’t happen but indications unfortunately go in another direction,” said International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi last Thursday.|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/150820163747-profile-background-stock-no-photo.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100

Nikolas Cruz, 24, is due to face more of his victims in court before Broward Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer formally levies the sentence recommended last month – an outcome that disappointed and angered many relatives of those he killed, including some who confronted Cruz Tuesday in court. “I’m too old to see you live out your life sentence, but I hope your ever(y) breathing moment here on Earth is miserable and you repent for your sins,” Theresa Robinovitz, the grandmother of slain 14-year-old Alyssa Alhadeff, told the shooter. “And burn in hell.” Cruz pleaded guilty last year to 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder for the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which despite the continued American gun violence epidemic remains the deadliest mass shooting at a US high school. The state sought the death penalty, and so Cruz’s trial moved to the sentencing phase, in which a jury was tasked with hearing prosecutors and defense attorneys argue reasons they felt he should or should not be put to death.The prosecution argued, in part, the shooting was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel and was premeditated and calculated. The defense, pushing for a life sentence, pointed to the shooter’s mental or intellectual deficits they said stemmed from prenatal alcohol exposure.Three jurors were persuaded to vote for life, sparing Cruz a death sentence, which in Florida a jury must unanimously recommend. Scherer must follow the jury’s recommendation of life without parole, per state law. Still, the life sentence fell short of what many of those Cruz wounded and the families of those he killed wanted. “He shouldn’t live,” Anthony Montalto III, whose older sister Gina, 14, was killed in the shooting, said Tuesday, “while my sister rots in the grave.”|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181114095410-dakin-andone-byline.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100

The latest additions bring the group’s total spend in the Pennsylvania race to $3.4 million. Arizona: MAGA Inc. also put an additional $1 million into advertising in the final week of Arizona’s US Senate race, bringing its total spend there to $3.9 million. GOP nominee Blake Masters has struggled to keep pace with Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly’s powerhouse fundraising and advertising advantage in this race, but MAGA Inc.’s reinforcements provide a boost for Masters in a race that’s looked increasingly close in the final stretch. Georgia: Finally, MAGA Inc. also added about $1 million to its final week advertising reservations in Georgia’s US Senate race, where another one of Trump’s hand-picked candidates, Herschel Walker, is challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock. MAGA Inc.’s total spend in the Georgia Senate race is now up to $3.6 million. More on these numbers: The new spending isn’t yet accompanied by any new advertisements but will increase the rotation of ads the group has already launched. Many of those spots echo typical Republican campaign talking points, criticizing Democrats for crime and inflation, two key issues for GOP voters this cycle.Trump’s super PAC unleashed millions in advertising across several key races in October, after he faced criticism for months of inactivity while his political committees raised and sat on hundreds of millions of dollars. Since October, the group has spent just over $16 million on advertising, the most coming in the Arizona, Georgia, and Pennsylvania Senate races. The group has also spent million advertising in Senate races in Ohio and Nevada, and hundreds of thousands more in the Michigan gubernatorial and attorney general races. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis plans to spend Sunday on a three-stop campaign tour that will have him on the opposite coast of Florida from former President Donald Trump’s Miami rally that day.As part of a final statewide blitz of Florida, DeSantis will hold events in Hillsborough, Sarasota and Lee counties on Sunday, his campaign announced Tuesday, setting the stage for dueling rallies between the two potential 2024 contenders just days before the midterm cycle comes to a close. In coming to South Florida, Trump said he was helping support Republican Sen. Marco Rubio’s bid for another six-year term. DeSantis, who is also facing reelection, was not listed on the event. CNN previously reported that DeSantis was not invited and did not ask to attend.There’s a striking contrast in closing campaign ads in the Wisconsin Senate race.A leaf-raking Ron Johnson asks if voters are “tired of the division and the anger” while pledging to address the country’s challenges and “always tell you the truth.”While Mandela Barnes, Johnson’s Democratic rival, is up with a new ad with a litany of attacks on the GOP incumbent’s record on taxes. “Ron Johnson looks out for himself, not us,” the narrator says to close the ad.Why this race matters: The Democrats’ majority in Congress is razor-thin. The Senate is a 50-50 split (with Vice President Kamala Harris’ tie-breaking vote giving them the advantage) and Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s control of the House rests on a slim margin. In 2022, 35 of the 100 Senate seats are on the ballotThe Justice Department – where among the ranks of leadership are President Joe Biden appointees with significant experience in voting rights – has taken several bold steps on voting issues, filing ambitious lawsuits and launching a task force to address threats against local election officials.But as voting gets underway in the first nationwide general election since former President Donald Trump’s 2020 election lies, the Justice Department has run into legal limitations constraining the federal government’s ability to act in the space and faces challenges in redirecting a large federal agency to fast-changing circumstances.The Justice Department has weighed in on a dispute over whether the gathering of activists – some of them armed – at Arizona ballot drop boxes to surveil voters amounts to illegal voter intimidation. DOJ’s lawyers argued that “vigilante ballot security efforts” and “private campaigns to video record voters” likely violate the Voting Rights Act.At least a half-dozen complaints of voter intimidation stemming from the alleged conduct were submitted by Arizona election officials to the Justice Department. But the department has given no indication what more, if anything, it is planning to do with the reports.In the bigger picture, one action DOJ is expected to take around Election Day is to send personnel to monitor specific jurisdictions. The practice of putting federal observers in place at polling places traces back to the 1965 passage of the Voting Rights Act, but how the department carries that monitoring out was impeded by the 2013 Supreme Court ruling that gutted parts of the VRA.Republicans meanwhile have condemned DOJ’s involvement in how elections are run. At a hearing where the department’s civil rights chief Kristen Clarke testified on legislation that would bolster the department’s authority under the VRA, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz complained that she and others in department leadership were “partisan activists who haven’t been shy about their hatred of voter integrity laws.”As aggressive as outside voting rights advocates want the Biden administration to be, there is an acknowledgment that some caution is necessary when it comes to DOJ interventions that reach beyond the traditional bounds of its authority.If the Justice Department decides to intervene in new types of circumstances with the aim of helping voters, it could set the precedent for similar interventions by a future DOJ that is being pressured to undermine an election, as former President Trump attempted after the 2020 election.Continue reading here. Half of Americans have confidence that the results of US elections reflect the will of the people, with Republicans less confident than Democrats in the fairness of the process and more likely to reject the idea that losing candidates have a responsibility to concede, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS. Fifty percent of adults say they’re at least somewhat confident that elections in America today reflect the will of the people, with the rest expressing little or no confidence. That represents a modest improvement from CNN’s polling this summer, when just 42% described themselves as confident. The shift is due largely to a modest rebound in trust among independents (49% say they’re at least somewhat confident in elections, up from 38%) and Republicans (41%, up from 29%). Trust remains highest among Democrats: 61% express at least some confidence, similar to the 57% who said the same this summer. The vast majority of Americans, 82%, say that losing candidates in their state have an obligation to accept the results and concede, but 17% say that losing candidates don’t face such an obligation. A quarter of Republicans say losing candidates don’t have an obligation to concede, compared with 7% of Democrats. Within the GOP, that view is concentrated among election deniers: 33% of Republicans who deny that Biden won the presidency fairly don’t think losing candidates should be obliged to acknowledge their loss, a view shared by only 8% of Republicans who accept the results of the 2020 election.Republicans are also less likely than Democrats to say that challenges by their own party’s losing candidates would be detrimental to public trust in the nation’s election system. A 71% majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say that a losing candidate from their party who challenged the results would be doing more to decrease confidence in American elections than to increase it. A smaller 54% majority of Republicans and Republican-leaners say that a losing GOP candidate would decrease confidence in elections by challenging the results.On both the Republican and Democratic sides, partisans are more likely than independents who lean toward their party to say that their candidate would be increasing confidence in elections by challenging results, and those without college degrees are also more likely than those with degrees to see such a move as confidence-inducing. On the GOP side, self-described conservatives are more likely than self-described moderates to say that challenging election results inspires confidence in the system; there’s not much of a similar ideological gap on the Democratic side.Read more about the poll here and watch CNN’s David Chalian break down the numbers: An enthusiastic Republican base and persistent concerns about the state of the economy place the GOP in a strong position with about a week to go in the race for control of the US House of Representatives, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS.The new survey out Wednesday shows that Democratic enthusiasm about voting is significantly lower than it was in 2018, when the Democratic Party took control of the House. Republican voters in the new poll express greater engagement with this year’s midterm election than Democrats across multiple questions gauging likelihood of vote.Overall, 27% of registered voters say they are extremely enthusiastic about voting this year, down from 37% just ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.The decline in enthusiasm comes almost entirely among Democrats.Four years ago, 44% of Democratic registered voters said they were extremely enthusiastic about voting; now, just 24% say the same. Among Republicans, the number has dipped only narrowly, from 43% to 38%.Here are the top issues for likely voters:The economy and inflation: About half of all likely voters (51%) say this will be the key issue determining their vote for Congress this year.Abortion: It is the top concern for 15% of likely voters.Other issues tested were chosen by fewer than 10% of likely voters each, including voting rights and election integrity (9%), gun policy (7%), immigration (6%), climate change (4%) and crime (3%).Former President Barack Obama campaigned in Nevada Tuesday night to try to shore up support for Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, who is widely viewed as the most vulnerable Democrat in the US Senate, urging Nevadans to cast their ballots for her as well as the state’s other Democratic candidates.“I’m here to tell you, Nevada, that tuning out is not an option. Moping and feeling cynical is not an option. The only way to make this economy fair is if we – all of us – fight for it,” Obama said.In this economic climate, Cortez Masto’s race against former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt is one of the GOP’s best opportunities to pick up a Democratic seat and gain control of the chamber.Many Nevadans are angry about an inflation rate that is among the highest in the nation and gas prices that are still averaging nearly $5 a gallon in a state where workers often drive long distances as part of their daily commute.Even though President Joe Biden narrowly won Nevada in 2020, he’s not on the trail for Cortez Masto in this race, which has become the third-most expensive Senate contest this fall.Instead, allies of the first Latina elected to the Senate looked to Obama to help fire up younger voters and Latino voters who might not otherwise turn out in a midterm election. Though working-class voters and Latino voters have helped power previous Democratic wins in the Silver State – particularly when the party was led by former Democratic Sen. Harry Reid – those groups have been disproportionately affected by the double hit of pandemic-era closures and high inflation.Employment has recovered to pre-pandemic levels in the tourism-dependent state, but voters remain nervous about the current economic climate.Read more here.The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has ordered that any general election ballots that are mailed in undated or incorrectly dated envelopes must be set aside and not counted by election boards.“We hereby direct that the Pennsylvania county boards of elections segregate and preserve any ballots contained in undated or incorrectly dated outer envelopes,” the court said in a Tuesday order in response to a lawsuit from the Republican National Committee, the Republican Congressional Committee and the Republican Party of Pennsylvania.Pennsylvania requires voters to sign and date the outer envelope when mailing in a ballot.In the 3-3 deadlocked order – a spot on the bench remains vacant after the chief justice died – the court acknowledged it was “evenly divided” on whether failing to count the undated or incorrectly dated ballots qualifies as a violation of federal election law. Three justices said they would find a violation of federal law, while three justices said they would find no violation.The case is the result of the lawsuit brought by state and national Republicans last month that alleged Pennsylvania’s acting secretary of commonwealth was circumventing the General Assembly by telling county boards to count ballots returned in a timely manner, but without a dated envelope.CNN has reached out to the Pennsylvania secretary of commonwealth’s office for comment.The two-page order didn’t provide any details about the justices’ reasoning, saying only that opinions would be released later.“This ruling is a massive victory for Pennsylvania voters and the rule of law,” said RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel in a statement. “Republicans went to court, and now Democrats and all counties have to follow the law: this is a milestone in Republicans’ ongoing efforts to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat in Pennsylvania and nationwide.”Pennsylvania does not start processing mail-in ballots until Election Day.President Joe Biden called the upcoming midterm election a choice between two “different visions for America” while holding a rare rally in Miami Gardens, Florida, on Tuesday. “This election is not a referendum. It’s a choice. It’s a choice between two vastly different visions for America,” Biden said at the Florida Memorial University rally.  Biden also warned Republicans were “coming after” the right to vote, warning once again that “democracy is on the ballot.”The President spent much of the speech painting what he called the “stark contrast” between Democrats and Republicans, including on issues of Social Security, Medicare, abortion and student loans.On student loans, Biden said, “They moaned and groaned about it and they challenged it in court, which they’re going to lose.”“Who in the hell do they think they are?” Biden asked the audience. The President used phrases he’s said in the past to describe some Republicans, including “Mega MAGA Republicans” and “not your father’s Republican Party.”Biden also once again slammed oil company profits as “outrageous” and said companies haven’t “met the commitment to invest in America and support the American people.”GOP Rep. Liz Cheney returned to the campaign trail in Michigan Tuesday night, receiving a standing ovation more than 1,600 miles from her Wyoming home — and a world away from the Republican politics that has been her family’s lifeblood.A week after Cheney offered a surprise endorsement of Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a Michigan Democrat whom she praised as “a good and honorable public servant,” Cheney traveled here to deliver the message in person. She said a peaceful transition of power was essential to a functioning democracy and should be demanded by Republicans and Democrats alike. “The chips are down for us. This is our time of testing,” Cheney said. “Not a single one of us in this room and not a single one of us across this country can be a bystander. We all must stand and defend this republic.”Slotkin, who was first elected in 2018, is the only Democrat serving in the House who represents a Congressional district won by Mitt Romney in 2012 and Trump in 2016 and 2020. She implored independents and Republicans to join her campaign, hoping that Cheney’s visit would offer a last-minute burst of support in a highly-competitive race.“Welcome to Michigan!” Slotkin said, bluntly acknowledging that she would never have imagined herself sharing a stage with Cheney two years ago. Cheney and Slotkin serve together on the House Armed Services Committee, sitting on different sides of the political aisle and holding starkly different views on many aspects of domestic and foreign policy. They said they came together through their shared views of what they believe are urgent threats to democracy.“The truth is that Liz and I differ on lots of substantive policy issues,” Slotkin said. “But there’s one really, really big thing that we agree on. That is preserving American democracy, the thing that all of us here and the two of us desperately, desperately love.” The rally, which was billed as “an evening for patriotism and bipartisanship,” drew a crowd of about 600 people to the East Lansing High School gymnasium. It was unlike anything Cheney held during her own race in Wyoming earlier this year.Her campaign stops were largely limited to living rooms and other private events, as she faced myriad security threats and the wrath of Republicans furious at her role on the committee investigating the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 202, and on her vote to impeach Donald Trump. Slotkin, a former CIA officer and Pentagon official during the Bush and Obama administrations, is locked in a competitive contest with GOP state Sen. Tom Barrett in Michigan’s 7th Congressional District, which is anchored in Lansing and nearby counties. Michigan Republicans were also taking careful note of Cheney’s visit.“This is going to fire up Republicans, certainly, it’s going to fire up independents,” Barrett told CNN in an interview Tuesday. “It’s going to fire up people who don’t want to see a permanent war machine continue to perpetuate in Washington DC.”Barrett, an Army veteran who served in Iraq, delivered a blistering critique of both Cheney and Slotkin. This week, he announced the endorsement of Harriet Hageman, who defeated Cheney in the Wyoming primary and is on her way to filling her seat.Slotkin dismissed the suggestion that Cheney’s visit could backfire. She said she was proud to invite her to Michigan and said it was incumbent on people in both parties to help protect the country’s fragile democracy.“When I look at the loudest voices, particularly on the other side of the aisle, including my opponent, it is not about policy. It is about denying the results of the 2020 election, drumming up fear and exclusion of other groups,” Slotkin said. “It feels to me that at the most senior levels, the soul has left the body. But here’s the thing, when republicans are out of whack, so are Democrats.”We’re just days from Election Day. Democrats are hoping to hold on to power, while Republicans yearn to gain control of both the House and the Senate. And while we all have guesses of what will happen, the truth is that we don’t know what will play out.With that uncertainty in mind, here are three different scenarios that could be key to how the battle for control shakes out.Georgia runoff determines Senate If you follow politics to any degree, you certainly have. Unlike other states with close Senate races, Georgia requires candidates to receive a majority of the vote to win on Election Day. If no candidate does, then a runoff between the top two candidates is held in December.The conditions are fairly ripe for such a scenario. Neither Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock nor Republican Herschel Walker is at 50% in the Georgia Senate polls. Libertarian Chase Oliver is pulling in 3% to 4%.If every other race goes exactly as the polls predict, Democrats will have 49 seats, not including Georgia. Republicans will have 50 seats. This means that whichever side wins in Georgia would control the Senate.The Senate actually gets projected early Then there’s the other side of the spectrum. Most people are anticipating that we won’t know who wins the Senate until days, if not weeks, after Election Day. That may be the case, but it’s far from a certainty.There are a few ways we could conceivably get a fairly fast call. The easiest way for it to happen is if the Republicans win both Georgia (with a majority to avoid a runoff) and Pennsylvania. That way, we’re probably not reliant on what could be longer counts in Arizona and Nevada.Another way this might happen is if there is a surprising result in the east. If Republicans have a very good night, they could win the New Hampshire Senate race, where Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan is running for reelection against Republican Don Bolduc. If Democrats have a very good night, they could win the Ohio Senate race, an open seat where Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan is facing off with Trump-endorsed J.D. Vance.An early call of the House Just weeks ago, the race for both the House and Senate looked close. While the Senate still does, it’s easy to see how the House could turn into a relative blowout.If that happens, we won’t have to wait for the West Coast. We won’t have to wait for the results from ranked-choice voting races.Instead, we’ll get a pretty good idea from even the earliest of poll closings. Consider a race like that for Virginia’s 2nd District, a swing district centered in Virginia Beach. Rep. Elaine Luria would likely win if Democrats are to be competitive in the House. If she’s defeated, Republicans are probably on their way to House control.If it’s a big Republican night, we could also see Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan go down in Indiana. Indiana, unlike a lot of other states, requires voters to have an excuse to vote absentee.The bottom line is that if Republicans end up with close to 240 seats (as they did in 2010), then the race for House control won’t be drawn out.Read more potential Election Day scenarios here and listen to the CNN Political Briefing podcast for more analysis on key races this midterm cycle here. There are 35 total Senate races happening this midterm election — seven of them are for empty seats, with six Republicans and one Democrat leaving. Here’s a look at who is fighting for the open spots: |https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/221101155013-01-bombed-building-ukr-110122.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/q_auto
4|https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/business/starbucks-union-organizers-risk-takers-22-ctrp/index.html|These baristas are leading a nationwide campaign to unionize Starbucks. It came at a cost|They came from very different backgrounds and different parts of the country, each with different reasons for seeking a job at Starbucks. Few of these workers had given any thought to unions when they started their jobs at the coffee chain. But now they are at the center of one of the most successful union organizing campaigns to take place in the United States in decades. Naomi Martinez, 25, of Phoenix, started working at Starbucks two years ago so she could afford to finish school. The company offers tuition support for an online program at Arizona State University. Michelle Eisen, 39, of Buffalo, New York, is the production stage manager at the local Irish Classical Theatre Company. She joined Starbucks in 2010 because she needed the health insurance. Tori Tambellini, 23, of Pittsburgh, started working at the coffee chain in 2019 because, as a junior in college in her first apartment, she wanted to earn some money to pay the rent — and also to get free coffee. And Nabretta Hardin, 23, of Memphis, said she wanted to work at her local Starbucks because it seemed like the workers there were having a good time interacting with customers.Martinez, Eisen, Tambellini and Hardin are among the hundreds of Starbucks baristas across the US who have helped organize their fellow workers and make union votes happen.The first Starbucks-owned store ever to vote for a union took place less than a year ago, in December 2021, at the location where Eisen worked. Since then workers at 243 other stores spread over 38 states have voted to join Starbucks Workers United — that’s more than five stores a week. Votes have been held at 25 other stores but the results have yet to be certified by the National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency that oversees the votes. And 18 additional locations are either in the process of conducting or awaiting votes. So far, the union has had an impressive 83% success rate among stores where votes have been completed.It’s been a true grassroots effort, with baristas at each store collecting signatures from their coworkers, pitching them to support the union and responding to the anti-union arguments being made by management.Martinez, Eisen, Tambellini and Hardin’s efforts have shaken up not only the coffee giant, but they have also inspired workers at other retailers and food services outlets around the country, fueling a surge in union-organizing votes so far this year, including Apple retail stores, Chipotle and Home Depot. “Winning is contagious,” said Todd Vachon, professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University. “It’s been very visible. It’s geographically diverse. There are shops in very red states, in the North and South, East and West. The pace it’s happening is breakneck. It’s remarkable.”But by taking a high-profile role in the unionization efforts at Starbucks, the four baristas, along with hundreds of their counterparts who have also been active in the effort, have put their own livelihoods at risk. Eisen has kept her job at the Buffalo store, but Hardin and Tambellini were fired after organizing efforts began, and Martinez says an organizer at her Phoenix store was fired. The union has filed unfair labor practices complaints on their behalf, as well as more than 100 other employees it says were wrongly discharged for their support of the union. “When they told me I was fired, I was scared about rent and groceries and I had just found out my car needed $900 of work to pass inspection, so I was really worried,” said Tambellini.Many of the employees who were fired said they had initially thought their strong work records would protect them from being let go even if they were active in supporting the union.“When I called my mom and told her I was supporting the union, the only thing she had to say was ‘They’re going to fire you,’” said Tambellini. “I said, ‘No way, my manager loves me, I’m award winning.’ So I was surprised how hard the company came down on me.”Hardin and six other union supporters at her Memphis store said they were fired for allowing a television crew working on a story about the organizing effort into the store after closing time.Hardin and several of her fired co-workers in Memphis were recently hired back after Starbucks lost the unfair labor practice case in front of both the NLRB and a federal court. Starbucks defends the firings and said it continues to appeal the decision that forced it to rehire the workers. “We filed the appeal because these individuals violated numerous policies by failing to maintain a secure work environment and uphold safety important standards,” said the company.Still, most of the fired workers nationwide remain off the job, including Tambellini. Both Tambellini and Starbucks said her firing came after she was cited for violating attendance rules. She denies she did anything wrong.Many of the workers have been able to land on their feet. Some have gone to work for the union itself, as paid organizers. Others have found a new job with employers desperate to find help in the current labor market.“The pizza place next door [to the Starbucks store I worked at] offered me a job almost immediately,” said Tambellini.Starbucks insists that none of the employees, which it refers to as “partners,” were fired for their union activity, and it continues to fight the cases alleging wrongful discharge before the NLRB or in court.“No Starbucks partner has been, or will be, disciplined for supporting or engaging in lawful union activity,” the company said in a statement. “But interest in a union does not exempt partners from following policies and procedures that apply to all partners.”The company said it respects employees’ right to vote for a union, but believes employees are better off without a “third party” such as a union stepping between management and workers. Richard Bensinger, a former organizing director at the AFL-CIO union federation and an adviser to Starbucks Workers United, said he’s never seen a more anti-union campaign conducted by any company.“It’s become an epidemic of firing all over the country,” he said. “It’s a targeting of union leaders for the smallest of things, such as violation of dress code. It’s not subtle.”The union has also filed complaints about Starbucks stores that were permanently closed after workers there voted for the union or filed for elections. Starbucks said the store closing decisions were made based on safety concerns for employees in the store, not on union activity.The union has filed 398 unfair labor practice complaints against Starbucks since the start of the organizing campaign last year, while Starbucks has filed 15 complaints against the union. The NLRB has investigated and has issued 43 complaints of its own, all against the company, covering 141 of the 398 charges filed by the union.Many of the organizers are young, like Hardin, Tambellini and Martinez, who are in their twenties.“Their energy and their unwillingness to accept the way things are is why we’re where we’re at,” Eisen said of her colleagues. “The newer generation doesn’t apologize for wanting more, and they’re not asking for permission. They’re just doing it.”In the past, most union-organizing efforts were at factories or other businesses where employees intended to spend their careers and wanted to improve jobs they expected to have for decades to come. But many of the union leaders at Starbucks, weren’t intending to stay long term. Even Eisen, who has worked for the company for 12 years, had been planning to quit before the organizing effort got underway last year, since the health insurance Starbucks offered no longer provided a level of coverage that made working there worth it to her.“The health benefits I had come to the company for — costs kept going up and benefits going down. I just didn’t think it was worth it anymore,” she said. “I think when I started there, part of the draw was they did care about their employees and the community. It was the last several years that things really shifted in how they were treating employees.”But even though they might not have intended to stay long-term at Starbucks and had never thought about unions before this, they say the Starbucks organizing campaign has become a central part of their lives, and almost a full-time job away from work.“The movement has literally changed my life,” said Martinez. “I have no intention of leaving my store at the very least until we get a first contract. I want to be involved in how my workplace runs.”Wanting to be involved is a driving force for many of the organizers. They say that beyond wanting to see improvements in pay and benefits, they mostly want a voice on the job, a voice they say can best be achieved with a union.Moreover, after working through a pandemic, many want rules put in place that will make them feel safe at work. And they want an opportunity to appeal what they say are unfair disciplinary write-ups or firings. It might be easy to dismiss what Starbucks Workers United has accomplished: The stores that have voted to join the union represent only about 6,000 of the company’s 235,000 employees at its US company stores. In addition, the union has yet to win any contracts for unionized employees. Both the union and management point to one another as the reason that negotiations haven’t progressed, even at the stores that have been organized for months.But the movement at Starbucks is an important change for the US labor force, which has seen union membership steadily fall over the last 40 years, from 16.8% of workers at private sector businesses in 1983, the first year the Labor Department started tracking union membership, to only 6.1% in 2021. Winning elections is hard for unions. Management faces few penalties if it fires employees for their support of a union — they only have to pay back pay, plus some interest, less whatever money the employee earned elsewhere while fired, with no penalties. Companies can close locations that are trying to organize. And they have the ability to require employees to sit through presentations at which they lay out arguments against voting for a union, and to make it difficult for union organizers to contact employees to make their case. The difficulty winning union votes is part of the reason so few US workers are represented by unions and the changing nature of the labor force is another. Not nearly as many jobs are in more heavily unionized industries, such as manufacturing or transportation, these days — and the jobs that do exist face more competition from nonunion rivals both here and overseas, leading to job losses at unionized businesses.Meanwhile retail and food services have become a far bigger share of the US economy, with more than 23 million jobs between them, or nearly twice as many as in US factories. Only 3.2% of retail and food service workers belong to unions. The Starbucks organizing campaign may have made only a small dent in that number so far, but it’s an important first step, said Rutgers’ Vachon.“We’re not a manufacturing economy any longer. We’re a service and knowledge economy. The Starbucks workers are really demonstrating that it’s possible to unionize in an industry where it was thought of as impossible to organize, due to high turnover and a large percentage of young people,” he said. “It turns out having so many young workers was a key to their success. Young people are the demographic that thinks they can change the world.”|https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/190924110225-risktakers-logo-fall-20190924-large-169.png?q=h_120,w_650,x_0,y_0/w_1280

If the prize rests at $1.2 billion, it would be the fourth-largest US lottery jackpot and second-biggest Powerball jackpot. The leader in both categories was a $1.586 billion Powerball grand prize shared by winners in California, Florida and Tennessee in January 2016.Ranked second and third for US jackpots are a $1.537 billion Mega Millions prize won in South Carolina in 2018 and a $1.337 billion Mega Millions jackpot won by an Illinois ticket this summer.If one ticket wins Wednesday night’s drawing and the holder chooses a lump-sum option, the ticket would yield a one-time payment of an estimated $596.7 million, Powerball says. Otherwise, the estimated $1.2 billion prize would be spread over 30 payments across 29 years.The last Powerball grand prize was awarded to a ticket in Pennsylvania on August 3 for a $206.9 million pot. |https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/221102080752-01-powerball-102822-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill
